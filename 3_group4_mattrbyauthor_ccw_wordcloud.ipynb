writer mentions a people who lived there and were so comfortable that they could not bear it any longer and drowned themselves my story is not the same as his i do not think herodotus had got the right account of the place i am going to tell you how it fared with a boy who went there  he lived in a low room over a coach-house and that was not by any means at the back of the north wind as his mother very well knew for one side of the room was built only of boards and the boards were so old that you might run a penknife through into the north wind and then let them settle between them which was the sharper i know that when you pulled it out again the wind would be after it like a cat after a mouse and you would know soon enough you were not at the back of the north wind still this room was not very cold except when the north wind blew stronger than usual  the room i have to do with now was always cold except in summer when the sun took the matter into his own hands indeed i am not sure whether i ought to call it a room at all for it was just a loft where they kept hay and straw and oats for the horses  and when little diamond but stop  i must tell you that his father who was a coachman had named him after a favourite horse and his mother had had no objection  when little diamond then lay there in bed he could hear the horses under him munching away in the dark or moving sleepily in their dreams for diamond's father had built him a bed in the loft with boards all round it because they had so little room in their own end over the coach-house and diamond's father put old diamond in the stall under the bed because he was a quiet horse and did not go to sleep standing but lay down like a reasonable creature but although he was a surprisingly reasonable creature yet when young diamond woke in the middle of the night and felt the bed shaking in the blasts of the north wind he could not help wondering whether if the wind should blow the house down and he were to fall through into the manger old diamond mightn't eat him up before he knew him in his night-gown and although old diamond was very quiet all night long yet when he woke he got up like an earthquake and then young diamond knew what o'clock it was or at least what was to be done next which was to go to sleep again as fast as he could  there was hay at his feet and hay at his head piled up in great trusses to the very roof indeed it was sometimes only through a little lane with several turnings which looked as if it had been sawn out for him that he could reach his bed at all for the stock of hay was of course always in a state either of slow ebb or of sudden flow sometimes the whole space of the loft with the little panes in the roof for the stars to look in would lie open before his open eyes as he lay in bed sometimes a yellow wall of sweet-smelling fibres closed up his view at the distance of half a yard sometimes when his mother had undressed him in her room and told him to trot to bed by himself he would creep into the heart of the hay and lie there thinking how cold it was outside in the wind and how warm it was inside there in his bed and how he could go to it when he pleased only he wouldn't just yet he would get a little colder first and ever as he grew colder his bed would grow warmer till at last he would scramble out of the hay shoot like an arrow into his bed cover himself up and snuggle down thinking what a happy boy he was he had not the least idea that the wind got in at a chink in the wall and blew about him all night for the back of his bed was only of boards an inch thick and on the other side of them was the north wind  now as i have already said these boards were soft and crumbly to be sure they were tarred on the outside yet in many places they were more like tinder than timber hence it happened that the soft part having worn away from about it little diamond found one night after he lay down that a knot had come out of one of them and that the wind was blowing in upon him in a cold and rather imperious fashion now he had no fancy for leaving things wrong that might be set right so he jumped out of bed again got a little strike of hay twisted it up folded it in the middle and having thus made it into a cork stuck it into the hole in the wall but the wind began to blow loud and angrily and as diamond was falling asleep out blew his cork and hit him on the nose just hard enough to wake him up quite and let him hear the wind whistling shrill in the hole he searched for his hay-cork found it stuck it in harder and was just dropping off once more when pop with an angry whistle behind it the cork struck him again this time on the cheek up he rose once more made a fresh stopple of hay and corked the hole severely but he was hardly down again before pop it came on his forehead he gave it up drew the clothes above his head and was soon fast asleep  although the next day was very stormy diamond forgot all about the hole for he was busy making a cave by the side of his mother's fire with a broken chair a three-legged stool and a blanket and then sitting in it his mother however discovered it and pasted a bit of brown paper over it so that when diamond had snuggled down the next night he had no occasion to think of it  presently however he lifted his head and listened who could that be talking to him the wind was rising again and getting very loud and full of rushes and whistles he was sure some one was talking and very near him too it was but he was not frightened for he had not yet learned how to be so he sat up and hearkened at last the voice which though quite gentle sounded a little angry appeared to come from the back of the bed he crept nearer to it and laid his ear against the wall then he heard nothing but the wind which sounded very loud indeed the moment however that he moved his head from the wall he heard the voice again close to his ear he felt about with his hand and came upon the piece of paper his mother had pasted over the hole against this he laid his ear and then he heard the voice quite distinctly there was in fact a little corner of the paper loose and through that as from a mouth in the wall the voice came  what do you mean little boy closing up my window  what window asked diamond  you stuffed hay into it three times last night i had to blow it out again three times  you can't mean this little hole it isn't a window it's a hole in my bed  i did not say it was a window  i said it was my window  but it can't be a window because windows are holes to see out of  well that's just what i made this window for  but you are outside  you can't want a window  you are quite mistaken windows are to see out of you say well i'm in my house and i want windows to see out of it  but you've made a window into my bed  well your mother has got three windows into my dancing room and you have three into my garret  but i heard father say when my mother wanted him to make a window through the wall that it was against the law for it would look into mr dyves's garden  the voice laughed  the law would have some trouble to catch me it said  but if it's not right you know said diamond that's no matter you shouldn't do it  i am so tall i am above that law said the voice  you must have a tall house then said diamond  yes a tall house  the clouds are inside it  dear me said diamond and thought a minute i think then you can hardly expect me to keep a window in my bed for you why don't you make a window into mr dyves's bed  nobody makes a window into an ash-pit said the voice rather sadly i like to see nice things out of my windows  but he must have a nicer bed than i have though mine is very nice so nice that i couldn't wish a better  it's not the bed i care about  it's what is in it but you just open that window  well mother says i shouldn't be disobliging but it's rather hard you see the north wind will blow right in my face if i do  i am the north wind  o-o-oh said diamond thoughtfully then will you promise not to blow on my face if i open your window  i can't promise that  but you'll give me the toothache mother's got it already  but what's to become of me without a window  i'm sure i don't know all i say is it will be worse for me than for you  no it will not you shall not be the worse for it i promise you that you will be much the better for it just you believe what i say and do as i tell you  well i can pull the clothes over my head said diamond and feeling with his little sharp nails he got hold of the open edge of the paper and tore it off at once  in came a long whistling spear of cold and struck his little naked chest he scrambled and tumbled in under the bedclothes and covered himself up  there was no paper now between him and the voice and he felt a little not frightened exactly i told you he had not learned that yet but rather queer for what a strange person this north wind must be that lived in the great house called out-of-doors i suppose  thought diamond and made windows into people's beds but the voice began again and he could hear it quite plainly even with his head under the bed-clothes it was a still more gentle voice now although six times as large and loud as it had been and he thought it sounded a little like his mother's  what is your name little boy it asked  diamond answered diamond under the bed-clothes  what a funny name  it's a very nice name returned its owner  i don't know that said the voice  well i do retorted diamond a little rudely  do you know to whom you are speaking  no said diamond  and indeed he did not for to know a person's name is not always to know the person's self  then i must not be angry with you you had better look and see though  diamond is a very pretty name persisted the boy vexed that it should not give satisfaction  diamond is a useless thing rather said the voice  that's not true diamond is very nice as big as two and so quiet all night and doesn't he make a jolly row in the morning getting upon his four great legs it's like thunder  you don't seem to know what a diamond is  oh don't i just diamond is a great and good horse and he sleeps right under me he is old diamond and i am young diamond or if you like it better for you're very particular mr north wind he's big diamond and i'm little diamond and i don't know which of us my father likes best  a beautiful laugh large but very soft and musical sounded somewhere beside him but diamond kept his head under the clothes  i'm not mr north wind said the voice  you told me that you were the north wind insisted diamond  i did not say mister north wind said the voice  well then i do for mother tells me i ought to be polite  then let me tell you i don't think it at all polite of you to say mister to me  well i didn't know better i'm very sorry  but you ought to know better  i don't know that  i do you can't say it's polite to lie there talking with your head under the bed-clothes and never look up to see what kind of person you are talking to i want you to come out with me  i want to go to sleep said diamond very nearly crying for he did not like to be scolded even when he deserved it  you shall sleep all the better to-morrow night  besides said diamond you are out in mr dyves's garden and i can't get there i can only get into our own yard  will you take your head out of the bed-clothes said the voice just a little angrily  no answered diamond half peevish half frightened  the instant he said the word a tremendous blast of wind crashed in a board of the wall and swept the clothes off diamond he started up in terror leaning over him was the large beautiful pale face of a woman her dark eyes looked a little angry for they had just begun to flash but a quivering in her sweet upper lip made her look as if she were going to cry what was the most strange was that away from her head streamed out her black hair in every direction so that the darkness in the hay-loft looked as if it were made of her hair but as diamond gazed at her in speechless amazement mingled with confidence for the boy was entranced with her mighty beauty her hair began to gather itself out of the darkness and fell down all about her again till her face looked out of the midst of it like a moon out of a cloud from her eyes came all the light by which diamond saw her face and her hair and that was all he did see of her yet the wind was over and gone  will you go with me now you little diamond i am sorry i was forced to be so rough with you said the lady  i will yes i will answered diamond holding out both his arms but he added dropping them how shall i get my clothes they are in mother's room and the door is locked  oh never mind your clothes you will not be cold i shall take care of that nobody is cold with the north wind  i thought everybody was said diamond  that is a great mistake most people make it however they are cold because they are not with the north wind but without it  if diamond had been a little older and had supposed himself a good deal wiser he would have thought the lady was joking but he was not older and did not fancy himself wiser and therefore understood her well enough again he stretched out his arms the lady's face drew back a little  follow me diamond she said  yes said diamond only a little ruefully  you're not afraid said the north wind  no ma'am but mother never would let me go without shoes  she never said anything about clothes so i dare say she wouldn't mind that  i know your mother very well said the lady she is a good woman i have visited her often i was with her when you were born i saw her laugh and cry both at once i love your mother diamond  how was it you did not know my name then ma'am please am i to say ma'am to you ma'am  one question at a time dear boy i knew your name quite well but i wanted to hear what you would say for it don't you remember that day when the man was finding fault with your name how i blew the window in  yes yes answered diamond eagerly our window opens like a door right over the coach-house door and the wind you ma'am came in and blew the bible out of the man's hands and the leaves went all flutter flutter on the floor and my mother picked it up and gave it back to him open and there    was your name in the bible the sixth stone in the high priest's breastplate  oh a stone was it said diamond i thought it had been a horse i did  never mind a horse is better than a stone any day well you see i know all about you and your mother  yes i will go with you  now for the next question  you're not to call me ma'am you must call me just my own name respectfully you know just north wind  well please north wind you are so beautiful i am quite ready to go with you  you must not be ready to go with everything beautiful all at once diamond  but what's beautiful can't be bad you're not bad north wind  no i'm not bad but sometimes beautiful things grow bad by doing bad and it takes some time for their badness to spoil their beauty so little boys may be mistaken if they go after things because they are beautiful  well i will go with you because you are beautiful and good too  ah but there's another thing diamond  what if i should look ugly without being bad look ugly myself because i am making ugly things beautiful what then  i don't quite understand you north wind you tell me what then  well i will tell you if you see me with my face all black don't be frightened if you see me flapping wings like a bat's as big as the whole sky don't be frightened if you hear me raging ten times worse than mrs bill the blacksmith's wife even if you see me looking in at people's windows like mrs eve dropper the gardener's wife you must believe that i am doing my work nay diamond if i change into a serpent or a tiger you must not let go your hold of me for my hand will never change in yours if you keep a good hold if you keep a hold you will know who i am all the time even when you look at me and can't see me the least like the north wind i may look something very awful do you understand  quite well said little diamond  come along then said north wind and disappeared behind the mountain of hay  diamond crept out of bed and followed her     chapter ii the lawn   when diamond got round the corner of the hay for a moment he hesitated the stair by which he would naturally have gone down to the door was at the other side of the loft and looked very black indeed for it was full of north wind's hair as she descended before him and just beside him was the ladder going straight down into the stable up which his father always came to fetch the hay for diamond's dinner through the opening in the floor the faint gleam of the-stable lantern was enticing and diamond thought he would run down that way  the stair went close past the loose-box in which diamond the horse lived when diamond the boy was half-way down he remembered that it was of no use to go this way for the stable-door was locked but at the same moment there was horse diamond's great head poked out of his box on to the ladder for he knew boy diamond although he was in his night-gown and wanted him to pull his ears for him this diamond did very gently for a minute or so and patted and stroked his neck too and kissed the big horse and had begun to take the bits of straw and hay out of his mane when all at once he recollected that the lady north wind was waiting for him in the yard  good night diamond he said and darted up the ladder across the loft and down the stair to the door but when he got out into the yard there was no lady  now it is always a dreadful thing to think there is somebody and find nobody children in particular have not made up their minds to it they generally cry at nobody especially when they wake up at night but it was an especial disappointment to diamond for his little heart had been beating with joy  the face of the north wind was so grand to have a lady like that for a friend with such long hair too why it was longer than twenty diamonds' tails she was gone and there he stood with his bare feet on the stones of the paved yard  it was a clear night overhead and the stars were shining orion in particular was making the most of his bright belt and golden sword but the moon was only a poor thin crescent there was just one great jagged black and gray cloud in the sky with a steep side to it like a precipice and the moon was against this side and looked as if she had tumbled off the top of the cloud-hill and broken herself in rolling down the precipice she did not seem comfortable for she was looking down into the deep pit waiting for her at least that was what diamond thought as he stood for a moment staring at her but he was quite wrong for the moon was not afraid and there was no pit she was going down into for there were no sides to it and a pit without sides to it is not a pit at all diamond however had not been out so late before in all his life and things looked so strange about him just as if he had got into fairyland of which he knew quite as much as anybody for his mother had no money to buy books to set him wrong on the subject i have seen this world only sometimes just now and then you know look as strange as ever i saw fairyland but i confess that i have not yet seen fairyland at its best i am always going to see it so some time but if you had been out in the face and not at the back of the north wind on a cold rather frosty night and in your night-gown you would have felt it all quite as strange as diamond did he cried a little just a little he was so disappointed to lose the lady  of course you little man wouldn't have done that but for my part i don't mind people crying so much as i mind what they cry about and how they cry whether they cry quietly like ladies and gentlemen or go shrieking like vulgar emperors or ill-natured cooks for all emperors are not gentlemen and all cooks are not ladies nor all queens and princesses for that matter either  but it can't be denied that a little gentle crying does one good it did diamond good for as soon as it was over he was a brave boy again  she shan't say it was my fault anyhow said diamond i daresay she is hiding somewhere to see what i will do i will look for her  so he went round the end of the stable towards the kitchen-garden but the moment he was clear of the shelter of the stable sharp as a knife came the wind against his little chest and his bare legs still he would look in the kitchen-garden and went on but when he got round the weeping-ash that stood in the corner the wind blew much stronger and it grew stronger and stronger till he could hardly fight against it and it was so cold all the flashy spikes of the stars seemed to have got somehow into the wind then he thought of what the lady had said about people being cold because they were not with the north wind how it was that he should have guessed what she meant at that very moment i cannot tell but i have observed that the most wonderful thing in the world is how people come to understand anything he turned his back to the wind and trotted again towards the yard whereupon strange to say it blew so much more gently against his calves than it had blown against his shins that he began to feel almost warm by contrast  you must not think it was cowardly of diamond to turn his back to the wind  he did so only because he thought lady north wind had said something like telling him to do so if she had said to him that he must hold his face to it diamond would have held his face to it but the most foolish thing is to fight for no good and to please nobody  well it was just as if the wind was pushing diamond along if he turned round it grew very sharp on his legs especially and so he thought the wind might really be lady north wind though he could not see her and he had better let her blow him wherever she pleased so she blew and blew and he went and went until he found himself standing at a door in a wall which door led from the yard into a little belt of shrubbery flanking mr coleman's house mr coleman was his father's master and the owner of diamond he opened the door and went through the shrubbery and out into the middle of the lawn still hoping to find north wind the soft grass was very pleasant to his bare feet and felt warm after the stones of the yard but the lady was nowhere to be seen then he began to think that after all he must have done wrong and she was offended with him for not following close after her but staying to talk to the horse which certainly was neither wise nor polite  there he stood in the middle of the lawn the wind blowing his night-gown till it flapped like a loose sail the stars were very shiny over his head but they did not give light enough to show that the grass was green and diamond stood alone in the strange night which looked half solid all about him he began to wonder whether he was in a dream or not it was important to determine this for thought diamond if i am in a dream i am safe in my bed and i needn't cry but if i'm not in a dream i'm out here and perhaps i had better cry or at least i'm not sure whether i can help it he came to the conclusion however that whether he was in a dream or not there could be no harm in not crying for a little while longer  he could begin whenever he liked  the back of mr coleman's house was to the lawn and one of the drawing-room windows looked out upon it the ladies had not gone to bed for the light was still shining in that window but they had no idea that a little boy was standing on the lawn in his night-gown or they would have run out in a moment and as long as he saw that light diamond could not feel quite lonely he stood staring not at the great warrior orion in the sky nor yet at the disconsolate neglected moon going down in the west but at the drawing-room window with the light shining through its green curtains he had been in that room once or twice that he could remember at christmas times for the colemans were kind people though they did not care much about children  all at once the light went nearly out  he could only see a glimmer of the shape of the window then indeed he felt that he was left alone it was so dreadful to be out in the night after everybody was gone to bed that was more than he could bear he burst out crying in good earnest beginning with a wail like that of the wind when it is waking up  perhaps you think this was very foolish for could he not go home to his own bed again when he liked yes but it looked dreadful to him to creep up that stair again and lie down in his bed again and know that north wind's window was open beside him and she gone and he might never see her again he would be just as lonely there as here nay it would be much worse if he had to think that the window was nothing but a hole in the wall  at the very moment when he burst out crying the old nurse who had grown to be one of the family for she had not gone away when miss coleman did not want any more nursing came to the back door which was of glass to close the shutters she thought she heard a cry and peering out with a hand on each side of her eyes like diamond's blinkers she saw something white on the lawn too old and too wise to be frightened she opened the door and went straight towards the white thing to see what it was and when diamond saw her coming he was not frightened either though mrs crump was a little cross sometimes for there is a good kind of crossness that is only disagreeable and there is a bad kind of crossness that is very nasty indeed so she came up with her neck stretched out and her head at the end of it and her eyes foremost of all like a snail's peering into the night to see what it could be that went on glimmering white before her when she did see she made a great exclamation and threw up her hands then without a word for she thought diamond was walking in his sleep she caught hold of him and led him towards the house he made no objection for he was just in the mood to be grateful for notice of any sort and mrs crump led him straight into the drawing-room  now from the neglect of the new housemaid the fire in miss coleman's bedroom had gone out and her mother had told her to brush her hair by the drawing-room fire a disorderly proceeding which a mother's wish could justify the young lady was very lovely though not nearly so beautiful as north wind and her hair was extremely long for it came down to her knees though that was nothing at all to north wind's hair yet when she looked round with her hair all about her as diamond entered he thought for one moment that it was north wind and pulling his hand from mrs crump's he stretched out his arms and ran towards miss coleman she was so pleased that she threw down her brush and almost knelt on the floor to receive him in her arms he saw the next moment that she was not lady north wind but she looked so like her he could not help running into her arms and bursting into tears afresh mrs crump said the poor child had walked out in his sleep and diamond thought she ought to know and did not contradict her for anything he knew it might be so indeed he let them talk on about him and said nothing and when after their astonishment was over and miss coleman had given him a sponge-cake it was decreed that mrs crump should take him to his mother he was quite satisfied  his mother had to get out of bed to open the door when mrs crump knocked she was indeed surprised to see her boy and having taken him in her arms and carried him to his bed returned and had a long confabulation with mrs crump for they were still talking when diamond fell fast asleep and could hear them no longer     chapter iii old diamond   diamond woke very early in the morning and thought what a curious dream he had had but the memory grew brighter and brighter in his head until it did not look altogether like a dream and he began to doubt whether he had not really been abroad in the wind last night he came to the conclusion that if he had really been brought home to his mother by mrs crump she would say something to him about it and that would settle the matter then he got up and dressed himself but finding that his father and mother were not yet stirring he went down the ladder to the stable there he found that even old diamond was not awake yet for he as well as young diamond always got up the moment he woke and now he was lying as flat as a horse could lie upon his nice trim bed of straw  i'll give old diamond a surprise thought the boy and creeping up very softly before the horse knew he was astride of his back then it was young diamond's turn to have more of a surprise than he had expected for as with an earthquake with a rumbling and a rocking hither and thither a sprawling of legs and heaving as of many backs young diamond found himself hoisted up in the air with both hands twisted in the horse's mane the next instant old diamond lashed out with both his hind legs and giving one cry of terror young diamond found himself lying on his neck with his arms as far round it as they would go but then the horse stood as still as a stone except that he lifted his head gently up to let the boy slip down to his back for when he heard young diamond's cry he knew that there was nothing to kick about for young diamond was a good boy and old diamond was a good horse and the one was all right on the back of the other  as soon as diamond had got himself comfortable on the saddle place the horse began pulling at the hay and the boy began thinking he had never mounted diamond himself before and he had never got off him without being lifted down so he sat while the horse ate wondering how he was to reach the ground  but while he meditated his mother woke and her first thought was to see her boy she had visited him twice during the night and found him sleeping quietly now his bed was empty and she was frightened  diamond diamond where are you diamond she called out  diamond turned his head where he sat like a knight on his steed in enchanted stall and cried aloud   here mother  where diamond she returned  here mother on diamond's back  she came running to the ladder and peeping down saw him aloft on the great horse  come down diamond she said  i can't answered diamond  how did you get up asked his mother  quite easily answered he but when i got up diamond would get up too and so here i am  his mother thought he had been walking in his sleep again and hurried down the ladder she did not much like going up to the horse for she had not been used to horses but she would have gone into a lion's den not to say a horse's stall to help her boy so she went and lifted him off diamond's back and felt braver all her life after she carried him in her arms up to her room but afraid of frightening him at his own sleep-walking as she supposed it said nothing about last night before the next day was over diamond had almost concluded the whole adventure a dream  for a week his mother watched him very carefully going into the loft several times a night as often in fact as she woke every time she found him fast asleep  all that week it was hard weather the grass showed white in the morning with the hoar-frost which clung like tiny comfits to every blade and as diamond's shoes were not good and his mother had not quite saved up enough money to get him the new pair she so much wanted for him she would not let him run out he played all his games over and over indoors especially that of driving two chairs harnessed to the baby's cradle and if they did not go very fast they went as fast as could be expected of the best chairs in the world although one of them had only three legs and the other only half a back  at length his mother brought home his new shoes and no sooner did she find they fitted him than she told him he might run out in the yard and amuse himself for an hour  the sun was going down when he flew from the door like a bird from its cage all the world was new to him a great fire of sunset burned on the top of the gate that led from the stables to the house above the fire in the sky lay a large lake of green light above that a golden cloud and over that the blue of the wintry heavens and diamond thought that next to his own home he had never seen any place he would like so much to live in as that sky for it is not fine things that make home a nice place but your mother and your father  as he was looking at the lovely colours the gates were thrown open and there was old diamond and his friend in the carriage dancing with impatience to get at their stalls and their oats and in they came diamond was not in the least afraid of his father driving over him but careful not to spoil the grand show he made with his fine horses and his multitudinous cape with a red edge to every fold he slipped out of the way and let him dash right on to the stables to be quite safe he had to step into the recess of the door that led from the yard to the shrubbery  as he stood there he remembered how the wind had driven him to this same spot on the night of his dream and once more he was almost sure that it was no dream at all events he would go in and see whether things looked at all now as they did then he opened the door and passed through the little belt of shrubbery not a flower was to be seen in the beds on the lawn even the brave old chrysanthemums and christmas roses had passed away before the frost what yes there was one he ran and knelt down to look at it  it was a primrose a dwarfish thing but perfect in shape a baby-wonder as he stooped his face to see it close a little wind began to blow and two or three long leaves that stood up behind the flower shook and waved and quivered but the primrose lay still in the green hollow looking up at the sky and not seeming to know that the wind was blowing at all it was just a one eye that the dull black wintry earth had opened to look at the sky with all at once diamond thought it was saying its prayers and he ought not to be staring at it so he ran to the stable to see his father make diamond's bed then his father took him in his arms carried him up the ladder and set him down at the table where they were going to have their tea  miss is very poorly said diamond's father mis'ess has been to the doctor with her to-day and she looked very glum when she came out again i was a-watching of them to see what doctor had said  and didn't miss look glum too asked his mother  not half as glum as mis'ess returned the coachman you see   but he lowered his voice and diamond could not make out more than a word here and there for diamond's father was not only one of the finest of coachmen to look at and one of the best of drivers but one of the most discreet of servants as well therefore he did not talk about family affairs to any one but his wife whom he had proved better than himself long ago and was careful that even diamond should hear nothing he could repeat again concerning master and his family  it was bed-time soon and diamond went to bed and fell fast asleep  he awoke all at once in the dark  open the window diamond said a voice  now diamond's mother had once more pasted up north wind's window  are you north wind said diamond  i don't hear you blowing  no but you hear me talking open the window for i haven't overmuch time  yes returned diamond but please north wind where's the use you left me all alone last time  he had got up on his knees and was busy with his nails once more at the paper over the hole in the wall for now that north wind spoke again he remembered all that had taken place before as distinctly as if it had happened only last night  yes but that was your fault returned north wind i had work to do and besides a gentleman should never keep a lady waiting  but i'm not a gentleman said diamond scratching away at the paper  i hope you won't say so ten years after this  i'm going to be a coachman and a coachman is not a gentleman  persisted diamond  we call your father a gentleman in our house said north wind  he doesn't call himself one said diamond  that's of no consequence  every man ought to be a gentleman and your father is one  diamond was so pleased to hear this that he scratched at the paper like ten mice and getting hold of the edge of it tore it off the next instant a young girl glided across the bed and stood upon the floor  oh dear said diamond quite dismayed i didn't know who are you please  i'm north wind  are you really  yes make haste  but you're no bigger than me  do you think i care about how big or how little i am didn't you see me this evening i was less then  no where was you  behind the leaves of the primrose didn't you see them blowing  yes  make haste then if you want to go with me  but you are not big enough to take care of me i think you are only miss north wind  i am big enough to show you the way anyhow but if you won't come why you must stay  i must dress myself i didn't mind with a grown lady but i couldn't go with a little girl in my night-gown  very well i'm not in such a hurry as i was the other night dress as fast as you can and i'll go and shake the primrose leaves till you come  don't hurt it said diamond  north wind broke out in a little laugh like the breaking of silver bubbles and was gone in a moment diamond saw for it was a starlit night and the mass of hay was at a low ebb now the gleam of something vanishing down the stair and springing out of bed dressed himself as fast as ever he could then he crept out into the yard through the door in the wall and away to the primrose behind it stood north wind leaning over it and looking at the flower as if she had been its mother  come along she said jumping up and holding out her hand  diamond took her hand it was cold but so pleasant and full of life it was better than warm she led him across the garden with one bound she was on the top of the wall diamond was left at the foot  stop stop he cried please i can't jump like that  you don't try said north wind who from the top looked down a foot taller than before  give me your hand again and i will try said diamond  she reached down diamond laid hold of her hand gave a great spring and stood beside her  this is nice he said  another bound and they stood in the road by the river it was full tide and the stars were shining clear in its depths for it lay still waiting for the turn to run down again to the sea they walked along its side but they had not walked far before its surface was covered with ripples and the stars had vanished from its bosom  and north wind was now tall as a full-grown girl her hair was flying about her head and the wind was blowing a breeze down the river but she turned aside and went up a narrow lane and as she went her hair fell down around her  i have some rather disagreeable work to do to-night she said before i get out to sea and i must set about it at once the disagreeable work must be looked after first  so saying she laid hold of diamond and began to run gliding along faster and faster diamond kept up with her as well as he could she made many turnings and windings apparently because it was not quite easy to get him over walls and houses once they ran through a hall where they found back and front doors open at the foot of the stair north wind stood still and diamond hearing a great growl started in terror and there instead of north wind was a huge wolf by his side he let go his hold in dismay and the wolf bounded up the stair the windows of the house rattled and shook as if guns were firing and the sound of a great fall came from above diamond stood with white face staring up at the landing  surely he thought north wind can't be eating one of the children  coming to himself all at once he rushed after her with his little fist clenched there were ladies in long trains going up and down the stairs and gentlemen in white neckties attending on them who stared at him but none of them were of the people of the house and they said nothing before he reached the head of the stair however north wind met him took him by the hand and hurried down and out of the house  i hope you haven't eaten a baby north wind said diamond very solemnly  north wind laughed merrily and went tripping on faster her grassy robe swept and swirled about her steps and wherever it passed over withered leaves they went fleeing and whirling in spirals and running on their edges like wheels all about her feet  no she said at last i did not eat a baby you would not have had to ask that foolish question if you had not let go your hold of me you would have seen how i served a nurse that was calling a child bad names and telling her she was wicked she had been drinking i saw an ugly gin bottle in a cupboard  and you frightened her said diamond  i believe so answered north wind laughing merrily i flew at her throat and she tumbled over on the floor with such a crash that they ran in she'll be turned away to-morrow and quite time if they knew as much as i do  but didn't you frighten the little one  she never saw me the woman would not have seen me either if she had not been wicked  oh said diamond dubiously  why should you see things returned north wind that you wouldn't understand or know what to do with good people see good things bad people bad things  then are you a bad thing  no for you see me diamond dear said the girl and she looked down at him and diamond saw the loving eyes of the great lady beaming from the depths of her falling hair  i had to make myself look like a bad thing before she could see me if i had put on any other shape than a wolf's she would not have seen me for that is what is growing to be her own shape inside of her  i don't know what you mean said diamond but i suppose it's all right  they were now climbing the slope of a grassy ascent it was primrose hill in fact although diamond had never heard of it the moment they reached the top north wind stood and turned her face towards london the stars were still shining clear and cold overhead there was not a cloud to be seen the air was sharp but diamond did not find it cold  now said the lady whatever you do do not let my hand go i might have lost you the last time only i was not in a hurry then  now i am in a hurry  yet she stood still for a moment     chapter iv north wind   and as she stood looking towards london diamond saw that she was trembling  are you cold north wind he asked  no diamond she answered looking down upon him with a smile i am only getting ready to sweep one of my rooms those careless greedy untidy children make it in such a mess  as she spoke he could have told by her voice if he had not seen with his eyes that she was growing larger and larger her head went up and up towards the stars and as she grew still trembling through all her body her hair also grew longer and longer and lifted itself from her head and went out in black waves the next moment however it fell back around her and she grew less and less till she was only a tall woman then she put her hands behind her head and gathered some of her hair and began weaving and knotting it together when she had done she bent down her beautiful face close to his and said   diamond i am afraid you would not keep hold of me and if i were to drop you i don't know what might happen so i have been making a place for you in my hair come  diamond held out his arms for with that grand face looking at him he believed like a baby she took him in her hands threw him over her shoulder and said get in diamond  and diamond parted her hair with his hands crept between and feeling about soon found the woven nest it was just like a pocket or like the shawl in which gipsy women carry their children north wind put her hands to her back felt all about the nest and finding it safe said   are you comfortable diamond  yes indeed answered diamond  the next moment he was rising in the air north wind grew towering up to the place of the clouds her hair went streaming out from her till it spread like a mist over the stars she flung herself abroad in space  diamond held on by two of the twisted ropes which parted and interwoven formed his shelter for he could not help being a little afraid as soon as he had come to himself he peeped through the woven meshes for he did not dare to look over the top of the nest the earth was rushing past like a river or a sea below him trees and water and green grass hurried away beneath a great roar of wild animals rose as they rushed over the zoological gardens mixed with a chattering of monkeys and a screaming of birds but it died away in a moment behind them and now there was nothing but the roofs of houses sweeping along like a great torrent of stones and rocks chimney-pots fell and tiles flew from the roofs but it looked to him as if they were left behind by the roofs and the chimneys as they scudded away there was a great roaring for the wind was dashing against london like a sea but at north wind's back diamond of course felt nothing of it all he was in a perfect calm he could hear the sound of it that was all  by and by he raised himself and looked over the edge of his nest there were the houses rushing up and shooting away below him like a fierce torrent of rocks instead of water then he looked up to the sky but could see no stars they were hidden by the blinding masses of the lady's hair which swept between he began to wonder whether she would hear him if he spoke he would try  please north wind he said what is that noise  from high over his head came the voice of north wind answering him gently   the noise of my besom i am the old woman that sweeps the cobwebs from the sky only i'm busy with the floor now  what makes the houses look as if they were running away  i am sweeping so fast over them  but please north wind i knew london was very big but i didn't know it was so big as this it seems as if we should never get away from it  we are going round and round else we should have left it long ago  is this the way you sweep north wind  yes i go round and round with my great besom  please would you mind going a little slower for i want to see the streets  you won't see much now  why  because i have nearly swept all the people home  oh i forgot said diamond and was quiet after that for he did not want to be troublesome  but she dropped a little towards the roofs of the houses and diamond could see down into the streets there were very few people about though the lamps flickered and flared again but nobody seemed to want them  suddenly diamond espied a little girl coming along a street she was dreadfully blown by the wind and a broom she was trailing behind her was very troublesome it seemed as if the wind had a spite at her it kept worrying her like a wild beast and tearing at her rags she was so lonely there  oh please north wind he cried won't you help that little girl  no diamond i mustn't leave my work  but why shouldn't you be kind to her  i am kind to her i am sweeping the wicked smells away  but you're kinder to me dear north wind why shouldn't you be as kind to her as you are to me  there are reasons diamond everybody can't be done to all the same everybody is not ready for the same thing  but i don't see why i should be kinder used than she  do you think nothing's to be done but what you can see diamond you silly it's all right of course you can help her if you like you've got nothing particular to do at this moment i have  oh do let me help her then but you won't be able to wait perhaps  no i can't wait you must do it yourself and mind the wind will get a hold of you too  don't you want me to help her north wind  not without having some idea what will happen if you break down and cry that won't be much of a help to her and it will make a goose of little diamond  i want to go said diamond only there's just one thing how am i to get home  if you're anxious about that perhaps you had better go with me i am bound to take you home again if you do  there cried diamond who was still looking after the little girl i'm sure the wind will blow her over and perhaps kill her do let me go  they had been sweeping more slowly along the line of the street there was a lull in the roaring  well though i cannot promise to take you home said north wind as she sank nearer and nearer to the tops of the houses i can promise you it will be all right in the end you will get home somehow have you made up your mind what to do  yes to help the little girl said diamond firmly  the same moment north wind dropt into the street and stood only a tall lady but with her hair flying up over the housetops she put her hands to her back took diamond and set him down in the street the same moment he was caught in the fierce coils of the blast and all but blown away north wind stepped back a step and at once towered in stature to the height of the houses a chimney-pot clashed at diamond's feet he turned in terror but it was to look for the little girl and when he turned again the lady had vanished and the wind was roaring along the street as if it had been the bed of an invisible torrent the little girl was scudding before the blast her hair flying too and behind her she dragged her broom her little legs were going as fast as ever they could to keep her from falling diamond crept into the shelter of a doorway thinking to stop her but she passed him like a bird crying gently and pitifully  stop stop little girl shouted diamond starting in pursuit  i can't wailed the girl the wind won't leave go of me  diamond could run faster than she and he had no broom in a few moments he had caught her by the frock but it tore in his hand and away went the little girl so he had to run again and this time he ran so fast that he got before her and turning round caught her in his arms when down they went both together which made the little girl laugh in the midst of her crying  where are you going asked diamond rubbing the elbow that had stuck farthest out the arm it belonged to was twined round a lamp-post as he stood between the little girl and the wind  home she said gasping for breath  then i will go with you said diamond  and then they were silent for a while for the wind blew worse than ever and they had both to hold on to the lamp-post  where is your crossing asked the girl at length  i don't sweep answered diamond  what do you do then asked she you ain't big enough for most things  i don't know what i do do answered he feeling rather ashamed nothing i suppose my father's mr coleman's coachman  have you a father she said staring at him as if a boy with a father was a natural curiosity  yes haven't you returned diamond  no nor mother neither old sal's all i've got and she began to cry again  i wouldn't go to her if she wasn't good to me said diamond  but you must go somewheres  move on said the voice of a policeman behind them  i told you so said the girl you must go somewheres they're always at it  but old sal doesn't beat you does she  i wish she would  what do you mean asked diamond quite bewildered  she would if she was my mother but she wouldn't lie abed a-cuddlin' of her ugly old bones and laugh to hear me crying at the door  you don't mean she won't let you in to-night  it'll be a good chance if she does  why are you out so late then asked diamond  my crossing's a long way off at the west end and i had been indulgin' in door-steps and mewses  we'd better have a try anyhow said diamond come along  as he spoke diamond thought he caught a glimpse of north wind turning a corner in front of them and when they turned the corner too they found it quiet there but he saw nothing of the lady  now you lead me he said taking her hand and i'll take care of you  the girl withdrew her hand but only to dry her eyes with her frock for the other had enough to do with her broom she put it in his again and led him turning after turning until they stopped at a cellar-door in a very dirty lane there she knocked  i shouldn't like to live here said diamond  oh yes you would if you had nowhere else to go to answered the girl i only wish we may get in  i don't want to go in said diamond  where do you mean to go then  home to my home  where's that  i don't exactly know  then you're worse off than i am  oh no for north wind  began diamond and stopped he hardly knew why  what said the girl as she held her ear to the door listening  but diamond did not reply neither did old sal  i told you so said the girl she is wide awake hearkening but we don't get in  what will you do then asked diamond  move on she answered  where  oh anywheres bless you i'm used to it  hadn't you better come home with me then  that's a good joke when you don't know where it is come on  but where  oh nowheres in particular come on  diamond obeyed the wind had now fallen considerably they wandered on and on turning in this direction and that without any reason for one way more than another until they had got out of the thick of the houses into a waste kind of place by this time they were both very tired diamond felt a good deal inclined to cry and thought he had been very silly to get down from the back of north wind not that he would have minded it if he had done the girl any good but he thought he had been of no use to her he was mistaken there for she was far happier for having diamond with her than if she had been wandering about alone she did not seem so tired as he was  do let us rest a bit said diamond  let's see she answered there's something like a railway there perhaps there's an open arch  they went towards it and found one and better still there was an empty barrel lying under the arch  hallo here we are said the girl a barrel's the jolliest bed going on the tramp i mean we'll have forty winks and then go on again  she crept in and diamond crept in beside her they put their arms round each other and when he began to grow warm diamond's courage began to come back  this is jolly he said i'm so glad  i don't think so much of it said the girl i'm used to it i suppose but i can't think how a kid like you comes to be out all alone this time o' night  she called him a kid but she was not really a month older than he was only she had had to work for her bread and that so soon makes people older  but i shouldn't have been out so late if i hadn't got down to help you said diamond north wind is gone home long ago  i think you must ha' got out o' one o' them hidget asylms said the girl you said something about the north wind afore that i couldn't get the rights of  so now for the sake of his character diamond had to tell her the whole story  she did not believe a word of it she said he wasn't such a flat as to believe all that bosh but as she spoke there came a great blast of wind through the arch and set the barrel rolling so they made haste to get out of it for they had no notion of being rolled over and over as if they had been packed tight and wouldn't hurt like a barrel of herrings  i thought we should have had a sleep said diamond but i can't say i'm very sleepy after all come let's go on again  they wandered on and on sometimes sitting on a door-step but always turning into lanes or fields when they had a chance  they found themselves at last on a rising ground that sloped rather steeply on the other side it was a waste kind of spot below bounded by an irregular wall with a few doors in it outside lay broken things in general from garden rollers to flower-pots and wine-bottles but the moment they reached the brow of the rising ground a gust of wind seized them and blew them down hill as fast as they could run nor could diamond stop before he went bang against one of the doors in the wall to his dismay it burst open when they came to themselves they peeped in it was the back door of a garden  ah ah cried diamond after staring for a few moments i thought so north wind takes nobody in here i am in master's garden i tell you what little girl you just bore a hole in old sal's wall and put your mouth to it and say 'please north wind mayn't i go out with you' and then you'll see what'll come  i daresay i shall but i'm out in the wind too often already to want more of it  i said with the north wind not in it  it's all one  it's not all one  it is all one  but i know best  and i know better i'll box your ears said the girl  diamond got very angry but he remembered that even if she did box his ears he musn't box hers again for she was a girl and all that boys must do if girls are rude is to go away and leave them so he went in at the door  good-bye mister said the girl  this brought diamond to his senses  i'm sorry i was cross he said come in and my mother will give you some breakfast  no thank you i must be off to my crossing it's morning now  i'm very sorry for you said diamond  well it is a life to be tired of what with old sal and so many holes in my shoes  i wonder you're so good i should kill myself  oh no you wouldn't when i think of it i always want to see what's coming next and so i always wait till next is over well i suppose there's somebody happy somewheres but it ain't in them carriages oh my how they do look sometimes fit to bite your head off good-bye  she ran up the hill and disappeared behind it then diamond shut the door as he best could and ran through the kitchen-garden to the stable and wasn't he glad to get into his own blessed bed again     chapter v the summer-house   diamond said nothing to his mother about his adventures he had half a notion that north wind was a friend of his mother and that if she did not know all about it at least she did not mind his going anywhere with the lady of the wind at the same time he doubted whether he might not appear to be telling stories if he told all especially as he could hardly believe it himself when he thought about it in the middle of the day although when the twilight was once half-way on to night he had no doubt about it at least for the first few days after he had been with her the girl that swept the crossing had certainly refused to believe him besides he felt sure that north wind would tell him if he ought to speak  it was some time before he saw the lady of the wind again indeed nothing remarkable took place in diamond's history until the following week this was what happened then diamond the horse wanted new shoes and diamond's father took him out of the stable and was just getting on his back to ride him to the forge when he saw his little boy standing by the pump and looking at him wistfully then the coachman took his foot out of the stirrup left his hold of the mane and bridle came across to his boy lifted him up and setting him on the horse's back told him to sit up like a man he then led away both diamonds together  the boy atop felt not a little tremulous as the great muscles that lifted the legs of the horse knotted and relaxed against his legs and he cowered towards the withers grasping with his hands the bit of mane worn short by the collar but when his father looked back at him saying once more sit up diamond he let the mane go and sat up notwithstanding that the horse thinking i suppose that his master had said to him come up diamond stepped out faster for both the diamonds were just grandly obedient and diamond soon found that as he was obedient to his father so the horse was obedient to him for he had not ridden far before he found courage to reach forward and catch hold of the bridle and when his father whose hand was upon it felt the boy pull it towards him he looked up and smiled and well pleased let go his hold and left diamond to guide diamond and the boy soon found that he could do so perfectly it was a grand thing to be able to guide a great beast like that and another discovery he made was that in order to guide the horse he had in a measure to obey the horse first if he did not yield his body to the motions of the horse's body he could not guide him he must fall off  the blacksmith lived at some distance deeper into london as they crossed the angle of a square diamond who was now quite comfortable on his living throne was glancing this way and that in a gentle pride when he saw a girl sweeping a crossing scuddingly before a lady the lady was his father's mistress mrs coleman and the little girl was she for whose sake he had got off north wind's back he drew diamond's bridle in eager anxiety to see whether her outstretched hand would gather a penny from mrs coleman but she had given one at the last crossing and the hand returned only to grasp its broom diamond could not bear it he had a penny in his pocket a gift of the same lady the day before and he tumbled off his horse to give it to the girl he tumbled off i say for he did tumble when he reached the ground but he got up in an instant and ran searching his pocket as he ran she made him a pretty courtesy when he offered his treasure but with a bewildered stare she thought first  then he was on the back of the north wind after all but looking up at the sound of the horse's feet on the paved crossing she changed her idea saying to herself north wind is his father's horse that's the secret of it why couldn't he say so and she had a mind to refuse the penny but his smile put it all right and she not only took his penny but put it in her mouth with a thank you mister did they wollop you then  oh no answered diamond they never wollops me  lor said the little girl and was speechless  meantime his father looking up and seeing the horse's back bare suffered a pang of awful dread but the next moment catching sight of him took him up and put him on saying   don't get off again diamond the horse might have put his foot on you  no father answered the boy and rode on in majestic safety  the summer drew near warm and splendid miss coleman was a little better in health and sat a good deal in the garden one day she saw diamond peeping through the shrubbery and called him he talked to her so frankly that she often sent for him after that and by degrees it came about that he had leave to run in the garden as he pleased he never touched any of the flowers or blossoms for he was not like some boys who cannot enjoy a thing without pulling it to pieces and so preventing every one from enjoying it after them  a week even makes such a long time in a child's life that diamond had begun once more to feel as if north wind were a dream of some far-off year  one hot evening he had been sitting with the young mistress as they called her in a little summer-house at the bottom of the lawn a wonderful thing for beauty the boy thought for a little window in the side of it was made of coloured glass it grew dusky and the lady began to feel chill and went in leaving the boy in the summer-house he sat there gazing out at a bed of tulips which although they had closed for the night could not go quite asleep for the wind that kept waving them about all at once he saw a great bumble-bee fly out of one of the tulips  there that is something done said a voice a gentle merry childish voice but so tiny at last it was i thought he would have had to stay there all night poor fellow i did  diamond could not tell whether the voice was near or far away it was so small and yet so clear he had never seen a fairy but he had heard of such and he began to look all about for one and there was the tiniest creature sliding down the stem of the tulip  are you the fairy that herds the bees he asked going out of the summer-house and down on his knees on the green shore of the tulip-bed  i'm not a fairy answered the little creature  how do you know that  it would become you better to ask how you are to know it  you've just told me  yes but what's the use of knowing a thing only because you're told it  well how am i to know you are not a fairy you do look very like one  in the first place fairies are much bigger than you see me  oh said diamond reflectively i thought they were very little  but they might be tremendously bigger than i am and yet not very big why i could be six times the size i am and not be very huge besides a fairy can't grow big and little at will though the nursery-tales do say so  they don't know better you stupid diamond have you never seen me before  and as she spoke a moan of wind bent the tulips almost to the ground and the creature laid her hand on diamond's shoulder in a moment he knew that it was north wind  i am very stupid he said but i never saw you so small before not even when you were nursing the primrose  must you see me every size that can be measured before you know me diamond  but how could i think it was you taking care of a great stupid bumble-bee  the more stupid he was the more need he had to be taken care of what with sucking honey and trying to open the door he was nearly dated and when it opened in the morning to let the sun see the tulip's heart what would the sun have thought to find such a stupid thing lying there with wings too  but how do you have time to look after bees  i don't look after bees i had this one to look after it was hard work though  hard work why you could blow a chimney down or or a boy's cap off  said diamond  both are easier than to blow a tulip open but i scarcely know the difference between hard and easy i am always able for what i have to do when i see my work i just rush at it and it is done but i mustn't chatter i have got to sink a ship to-night  sink a ship what with men in it  yes and women too  how dreadful i wish you wouldn't talk so  it is rather dreadful but it is my work i must do it  i hope you won't ask me to go with you  no i won't ask you but you must come for all that  i won't then  won't you and north wind grew a tall lady and looked him in the eyes and diamond said   please take me you cannot be cruel  no i could not be cruel if i would i can do nothing cruel although i often do what looks like cruel to those who do not know what i really am doing the people they say i drown i only carry away to to to well the back of the north wind that is what they used to call it long ago only i never saw the place  how can you carry them there if you never saw it  i know the way  but how is it you never saw it  because it is behind me  but you can look round  not far enough to see my own back no i always look before me in fact i grow quite blind and deaf when i try to see my back i only mind my work  but how does it be your work  ah that i can't tell you i only know it is because when i do it i feel all right and when i don't i feel all wrong east wind says only one does not exactly know how much to believe of what she says for she is very naughty sometimes she says it is all managed by a baby but whether she is good or naughty when she says that i don't know i just stick to my work it is all one to me to let a bee out of a tulip or to sweep the cobwebs from the sky you would like to go with me to-night  i don't want to see a ship sunk  but suppose i had to take you  why then of course i must go  there's a good diamond i think i had better be growing a bit only you must go to bed first i can't take you till you're in bed that's the law about the children so i had better go and do something else first  very well north wind said diamond what are you going to do first if you please  i think i may tell you jump up on the top of the wall there  i can't  ah and i can't help you you haven't been to bed yet you see come out to the road with me just in front of the coach-house and i will show you  north wind grew very small indeed so small that she could not have blown the dust off a dusty miller as the scotch children call a yellow auricula diamond could not even see the blades of grass move as she flitted along by his foot they left the lawn went out by the wicket in the-coach-house gates and then crossed the road to the low wall that separated it from the river  you can get up on this wall diamond said north wind  yes but my mother has forbidden me  then don't said north wind  but i can see over said diamond  ah to be sure i can't  so saying north wind gave a little bound and stood on the top of the wall she was just about the height a dragon-fly would be if it stood on end  you darling said diamond seeing what a lovely little toy-woman she was  don't be impertinent master diamond said north wind if there's one thing makes me more angry than another it is the way you humans judge things by their size i am quite as respectable now as i shall be six hours after this when i take an east indiaman by the royals twist her round and push her under you have no right to address me in such a fashion  but as she spoke the tiny face wore the smile of a great grand woman she was only having her own beautiful fun out of diamond and true woman's fun never hurts  but look there she resumed do you see a boat with one man in it a green and white boat  yes quite well  that's a poet  i thought you said it was a bo-at  stupid pet don't you know what a poet is  why a thing to sail on the water in  well perhaps you're not so far wrong some poets do carry people over the sea but i have no business to talk so much the man is a poet  the boat is a boat said diamond  can't you spell asked north wind  not very well  so i see a poet is not a bo-at as you call it a poet is a man who is glad of something and tries to make other people glad of it too  ah now i know like the man in the sweety-shop  not very but i see it is no use i wasn't sent to tell you and so i can't tell you i must be off only first just look at the man  he's not much of a rower said diamond paddling first with one fin and then with the other  now look here said north wind  and she flashed like a dragon-fly across the water whose surface rippled and puckered as she passed the next moment the man in the boat glanced about him and bent to his oars the boat flew over the rippling water man and boat and river were awake the same instant almost north wind perched again upon the river wall  how did you do that asked diamond  i blew in his face answered north wind i don't see how that could do it said diamond i daresay not and therefore you will say you don't believe it could  no no dear north wind i know you too well not to believe you  well i blew in his face and that woke him up  but what was the good of it  why don't you see look at him how he is pulling i blew the mist out of him  how was that  that is just what i cannot tell you  but you did it  yes i have to do ten thousand things without being able to tell how  i don't like that said diamond  he was staring after the boat hearing no answer he looked down to the wall  north wind was gone away across the river went a long ripple what sailors call a cat's paw the man in the boat was putting up a sail the moon was coming to herself on the edge of a great cloud and the sail began to shine white diamond rubbed his eyes and wondered what it was all about things seemed going on around him and all to understand each other but he could make nothing of it so he put his hands in his pockets and went in to have his tea the night was very hot for the wind had fallen again  you don't seem very well to-night diamond said his mother  i am quite well mother returned diamond who was only puzzled  i think you had better go to bed she added  very well mother he answered  he stopped for one moment to look out of the window above the moon the clouds were going different ways somehow or other this troubled him but notwithstanding he was soon fast asleep  he woke in the middle of the night and the darkness a terrible noise was rumbling overhead like the rolling beat of great drums echoing through a brazen vault the roof of the loft in which he lay had no ceiling only the tiles were between him and the sky for a while he could not come quite awake for the noise kept beating him down so that his heart was troubled and fluttered painfully a second peal of thunder burst over his head and almost choked him with fear nor did he recover until the great blast that followed having torn some tiles off the roof sent a spout of wind down into his bed and over his face which brought him wide awake and gave him back his courage the same moment he heard a mighty yet musical voice calling him  come up diamond it said it's all ready i'm waiting for you  he looked out of the bed and saw a gigantic powerful but most lovely arm with a hand whose fingers were nothing the less ladylike that they could have strangled a boa-constrictor or choked a tigress off its prey stretched down through a big hole in the roof without a moment's hesitation he reached out his tiny one and laid it in the grand palm before him     chapter vi out in the storm   the hand felt its way up his arm and grasping it gently and strongly above the elbow lifted diamond from the bed the moment he was through the hole in the roof all the winds of heaven seemed to lay hold upon him and buffet him hither and thither his hair blew one way his night-gown another his legs threatened to float from under him and his head to grow dizzy with the swiftness of the invisible assailant cowering he clung with the other hand to the huge hand which held his arm and fear invaded his heart  oh north wind he murmured but the words vanished from his lips as he had seen the soap-bubbles that burst too soon vanish from the mouth of his pipe the wind caught them and they were nowhere they couldn't get out at all but were torn away and strangled and yet north wind heard them and in her answer it seemed to diamond that just because she was so big and could not help it and just because her ear and her mouth must seem to him so dreadfully far away she spoke to him more tenderly and graciously than ever before her voice was like the bass of a deep organ without the groan in it like the most delicate of violin tones without the wail in it like the most glorious of trumpet-ejaculations without the defiance in it like the sound of falling water without the clatter and clash in it  it was like all of them and neither of them all of them without their faults each of them without its peculiarity  after all it was more like his mother's voice than anything else in the world  diamond dear she said be a man what is fearful to you is not the least fearful to me  but it can't hurt you murmured diamond for you're it  then if i'm it and have you in my arms how can it hurt you  oh yes i see whispered diamond but it looks so dreadful and it pushes me about so  yes it does my dear that is what it was sent for  at the same moment a peal of thunder which shook diamond's heart against the sides of his bosom hurtled out of the heavens  i cannot say out of the sky for there was no sky diamond had not seen the lightning for he had been intent on finding the face of north wind every moment the folds of her garment would sweep across his eyes and blind him but between he could just persuade himself that he saw great glories of woman's eyes looking down through rifts in the mountainous clouds over his head  he trembled so at the thunder that his knees failed him and he sunk down at north wind's feet and clasped her round the column of her ankle she instantly stooped lifted him from the roof up up into her bosom and held him there saying as if to an inconsolable child   diamond dear this will never do  oh yes it will answered diamond i am all right now quite comfortable i assure you dear north wind if you will only let me stay here i shall be all right indeed  but you will feel the wind here diamond  i don't mind that a bit so long as i feel your arms through it  answered diamond nestling closer to her grand bosom  brave boy returned north wind pressing him closer  no said diamond i don't see that it's not courage at all so long as i feel you there  but hadn't you better get into my hair then you would not feel the wind you will here  ah but dear north wind you don't know how nice it is to feel your arms about me it is a thousand times better to have them and the wind together than to have only your hair and the back of your neck and no wind at all  but it is surely more comfortable there  well perhaps but i begin to think there are better things than being comfortable  yes indeed there are well i will keep you in front of me you will feel the wind but not too much i shall only want one arm to take care of you the other will be quite enough to sink the ship  oh dear north wind how can you talk so  my dear boy i never talk i always mean what i say  then you do mean to sink the ship with the other hand  yes  it's not like you  how do you know that  quite easily here you are taking care of a poor little boy with one arm and there you are sinking a ship with the other it can't be like you  ah but which is me i can't be two mes you know  no nobody can be two mes  well which me is me  now i must think there looks to be two  yes that's the very point you can't be knowing the thing you don't know can you  no  which me do you know  the kindest goodest best me in the world answered diamond clinging to north wind  why am i good to you  i don't know  have you ever done anything for me  no  then i must be good to you because i choose to be good to you  yes  why should i choose  because because because you like  why should i like to be good to you  i don't know except it be because it's good to be good to me  that's just it i am good to you because i like to be good  then why shouldn't you be good to other people as well as to me  that's just what i don't know why shouldn't i  i don't know either then why shouldn't you  because i am  there it is again said diamond i don't see that you are it looks quite the other thing  well but listen to me diamond you know the one me you say and that is good  yes  do you know the other me as well  no i can't i shouldn't like to  there it is you don't know the other me you are sure of one of them  yes  and you are sure there can't be two mes  yes  then the me you don't know must be the same as the me you do know else there would be two mes  yes  then the other me you don't know must be as kind as the me you do know  yes  besides i tell you that it is so only it doesn't look like it that i confess freely have you anything more to object  no no dear north wind i am quite satisfied  then i will tell you something you might object you might say that the me you know is like the other me and that i am cruel all through  i know that can't be because you are so kind  but that kindness might be only a pretence for the sake of being more cruel afterwards  diamond clung to her tighter than ever crying   no no dear north wind i can't believe that i don't believe it i won't believe it that would kill me i love you and you must love me else how did i come to love you how could you know how to put on such a beautiful face if you did not love me and the rest no you may sink as many ships as you like and i won't say another word i can't say i shall like to see it you know  that's quite another thing said north wind and as she spoke she gave one spring from the roof of the hay-loft and rushed up into the clouds with diamond on her left arm close to her heart and as if the clouds knew she had come they burst into a fresh jubilation of thunderous light for a few moments diamond seemed to be borne up through the depths of an ocean of dazzling flame the next the winds were writhing around him like a storm of serpents for they were in the midst of the clouds and mists and they of course took the shapes of the wind eddying and wreathing and whirling and shooting and dashing about like grey and black water so that it was as if the wind itself had taken shape and he saw the grey and black wind tossing and raving most madly all about him now it blinded him by smiting him upon the eyes now it deafened him by bellowing in his ears for even when the thunder came he knew now that it was the billows of the great ocean of the air dashing against each other in their haste to fill the hollow scooped out by the lightning now it took his breath quite away by sucking it from his body with the speed of its rush but he did not mind it he only gasped first and then laughed for the arm of north wind was about him and he was leaning against her bosom it is quite impossible for me to describe what he saw did you ever watch a great wave shoot into a winding passage amongst rocks if you ever did you would see that the water rushed every way at once some of it even turning back and opposing the rest greater confusion you might see nowhere except in a crowd of frightened people well the wind was like that except that it went much faster and therefore was much wilder and twisted and shot and curled and dodged and clashed and raved ten times more madly than anything else in creation except human passions diamond saw the threads of the lady's hair streaking it all in parts indeed he could not tell which was hair and which was black storm and vapour it seemed sometimes that all the great billows of mist-muddy wind were woven out of the crossing lines of north wind's infinite hair sweeping in endless intertwistings and diamond felt as the wind seized on his hair which his mother kept rather long as if he too was a part of the storm and some of its life went out from him but so sheltered was he by north wind's arm and bosom that only at times in the fiercer onslaught of some curl-billowed eddy did he recognise for a moment how wild was the storm in which he was carried nestling in its very core and formative centre  it seemed to diamond likewise that they were motionless in this centre and that all the confusion and fighting went on around them flash after flash illuminated the fierce chaos revealing in varied yellow and blue and grey and dusky red the vapourous contention peal after peal of thunder tore the infinite waste but it seemed to diamond that north wind and he were motionless all but the hair it was not so they were sweeping with the speed of the wind itself towards the sea     chapter vii the cathedral   i must not go on describing what cannot be described for nothing is more wearisome  before they reached the sea diamond felt north wind's hair just beginning to fall about him  is the storm over north wind he called out  no diamond i am only waiting a moment to set you down you would not like to see the ship sunk and i am going to give you a place to stop in till i come back for you  oh thank you said diamond i shall be sorry to leave you north wind but i would rather not see the ship go down and i'm afraid the poor people will cry and i should hear them oh dear  there are a good many passengers on board and to tell the truth diamond i don't care about your hearing the cry you speak of i am afraid you would not get it out of your little head again for a long time  but how can you bear it then north wind for i am sure you are kind i shall never doubt that again  i will tell you how i am able to bear it diamond  i am always hearing through every noise through all the noise i am making myself even the sound of a far-off song i do not exactly know where it is or what it means and i don't hear much of it only the odour of its music as it were flitting across the great billows of the ocean outside this air in which i make such a storm but what i do hear is quite enough to make me able to bear the cry from the drowning ship so it would you if you could hear it  no it wouldn't returned diamond stoutly for they wouldn't hear the music of the far-away song and if they did it wouldn't do them any good you see you and i are not going to be drowned and so we might enjoy it  but you have never heard the psalm and you don't know what it is like somehow i can't say how it tells me that all is right that it is coming to swallow up all cries  but that won't do them any good the people i mean persisted diamond  it must it must said north wind hurriedly it wouldn't be the song it seems to be if it did not swallow up all their fear and pain too and set them singing it themselves with the rest i am sure it will and do you know ever since i knew i had hair that is ever since it began to go out and away that song has been coming nearer and nearer only i must say it was some thousand years before i heard it  but how can you say it was coming nearer when you did not hear it  asked doubting little diamond  since i began to hear it i know it is growing louder therefore i judge it was coming nearer and nearer until i did hear it first i'm not so very old you know a few thousand years only and i was quite a baby when i heard the noise first but i knew it must come from the voices of people ever so much older and wiser than i was i can't sing at all except now and then and i can never tell what my song is going to be i only know what it is after i have sung it but this will never do will you stop here  i can't see anywhere to stop said diamond your hair is all down like a darkness and i can't see through it if i knock my eyes into it ever so much  look then said north wind and with one sweep of her great white arm she swept yards deep of darkness like a great curtain from before the face of the boy  and lo it was a blue night lit up with stars where it did not shine with stars it shimmered with the milk of the stars except where just opposite to diamond's face the grey towers of a cathedral blotted out each its own shape of sky and stars  oh what's that cried diamond struck with a kind of terror for he had never seen a cathedral and it rose before him with an awful reality in the midst of the wide spaces conquering emptiness with grandeur  a very good place for you to wait in said north wind but we shall go in and you shall judge for yourself  there was an open door in the middle of one of the towers leading out upon the roof and through it they passed then north wind set diamond on his feet and he found himself at the top of a stone stair which went twisting away down into the darkness for only a little light came in at the door it was enough however to allow diamond to see that north wind stood beside him he looked up to find her face and saw that she was no longer a beautiful giantess but the tall gracious lady he liked best to see she took his hand and giving him the broad part of the spiral stair to walk on led him down a good way then opening another little door led him out upon a narrow gallery that ran all round the central part of the church on the ledges of the windows of the clerestory and through openings in the parts of the wall that divided the windows from each other it was very narrow and except when they were passing through the wall diamond saw nothing to keep him from falling into the church it lay below him like a great silent gulf hollowed in stone and he held his breath for fear as he looked down  what are you trembling for little diamond said the lady as she walked gently along with her hand held out behind her leading him for there was not breadth enough for them to walk side by side  i am afraid of falling down there answered diamond it is so deep down  yes rather answered north wind but you were a hundred times higher a few minutes ago  ah yes but somebody's arm was about me then said diamond putting his little mouth to the beautiful cold hand that had a hold of his  what a dear little warm mouth you've got said north wind it is a pity you should talk nonsense with it don't you know i have a hold of you  yes but i'm walking on my own legs and they might slip i can't trust myself so well as your arms  but i have a hold of you i tell you foolish child  yes but somehow i can't feel comfortable  if you were to fall and my hold of you were to give way i should be down after you in a less moment than a lady's watch can tick and catch you long before you had reached the ground  i don't like it though said diamond  oh oh oh he screamed the next moment bent double with terror for north wind had let go her hold of his hand and had vanished leaving him standing as if rooted to the gallery  she left the words come after me sounding in his ears  but move he dared not in a moment more he would from very terror have fallen into the church but suddenly there came a gentle breath of cool wind upon his face and it kept blowing upon him in little puffs and at every puff diamond felt his faintness going away and his fear with it courage was reviving in his little heart and still the cool wafts of the soft wind breathed upon him and the soft wind was so mighty and strong within its gentleness that in a minute more diamond was marching along the narrow ledge as fearless for the time as north wind herself  he walked on and on with the windows all in a row on one side of him and the great empty nave of the church echoing to every one of his brave strides on the other until at last he came to a little open door from which a broader stair led him down and down and down till at last all at once he found himself in the arms of north wind who held him close to her and kissed him on the forehead diamond nestled to her and murmured into her bosom why did you leave me dear north wind  because i wanted you to walk alone she answered  but it is so much nicer here said diamond  i daresay but i couldn't hold a little coward to my heart it would make me so cold  but i wasn't brave of myself said diamond whom my older readers will have already discovered to be a true child in this that he was given to metaphysics it was the wind that blew in my face that made me brave wasn't it now north wind  yes  i know that you had to be taught what courage was and you couldn't know what it was without feeling it  therefore it was given you but don't you feel as if you would try to be brave yourself next time  yes i do but trying is not much  yes it is a very great deal for it is a beginning and a beginning is the greatest thing of all to try to be brave is to be brave the coward who tries to be brave is before the man who is brave because he is made so and never had to try  how kind you are north wind  i am only just all kindness is but justice we owe it  i don't quite understand that  never mind you will some day there is no hurry about understanding it now  who blew the wind on me that made me brave  i did  i didn't see you  therefore you can believe me  yes yes of course but how was it that such a little breath could be so strong  that i don't know  but you made it strong  no  i only blew it i knew it would make you strong just as it did the man in the boat you remember but how my breath has that power i cannot tell it was put into it when i was made that is all i know but really i must be going about my work  ah the poor ship i wish you would stop here and let the poor ship go  that i dare not do will you stop here till i come back  yes you won't be long  not longer than i can help trust me you shall get home before the morning  in a moment north wind was gone and the next diamond heard a moaning about the church which grew and grew to a roaring the storm was up again and he knew that north wind's hair was flying  the church was dark only a little light came through the windows which were almost all of that precious old stained glass which is so much lovelier than the new but diamond could not see how beautiful they were for there was not enough of light in the stars to show the colours of them he could only just distinguish them from the walls he looked up but could not see the gallery along which he had passed he could only tell where it was far up by the faint glimmer of the windows of the clerestory whose sills made part of it the church grew very lonely about him and he began to feel like a child whose mother has forsaken it only he knew that to be left alone is not always to be forsaken  he began to feel his way about the place and for a while went wandering up and down his little footsteps waked little answering echoes in the great house it wasn't too big to mind him it was as if the church knew he was there and meant to make itself his house so it went on giving back an answer to every step until at length diamond thought he should like to say something out loud and see what the church would answer but he found he was afraid to speak he could not utter a word for fear of the loneliness perhaps it was as well that he did not for the sound of a spoken word would have made him feel the place yet more deserted and empty but he thought he could sing he was fond of singing and at home he used to sing to tunes of his own all the nursery rhymes he knew so he began to try `hey diddle diddle' but it wouldn't do then he tried `little boy blue' but it was no better neither would `sing a song of sixpence' sing itself at all then he tried `poor old cockytoo' but he wouldn't do they all sounded so silly and he had never thought them silly before so he was quiet and listened to the echoes that came out of the dark corners in answer to his footsteps  at last he gave a great sigh and said i'm so tired but he did not hear the gentle echo that answered from far away over his head for at the same moment he came against the lowest of a few steps that stretched across the church and fell down and hurt his arm he cried a little first and then crawled up the steps on his hands and knees at the top he came to a little bit of carpet on which he lay down and there he lay staring at the dull window that rose nearly a hundred feet above his head  now this was the eastern window of the church and the moon was at that moment just on the edge of the horizon the next she was peeping over it and lo with the moon st john and st paul and the rest of them began to dawn in the window in their lovely garments diamond did not know that the wonder-working moon was behind and he thought all the light was coming out of the window itself and that the good old men were appearing to help him growing out of the night and the darkness because he had hurt his arm and was very tired and lonely and north wind was so long in coming so he lay and looked at them backwards over his head wondering when they would come down or what they would do next they were very dim for the moonlight was not strong enough for the colours and he had enough to do with his eyes trying to make out their shapes so his eyes grew tired and more and more tired and his eyelids grew so heavy that they would keep tumbling down over his eyes he kept lifting them and lifting them but every time they were heavier than the last it was no use  they were too much for him sometimes before he had got them half up down they were again and at length he gave it up quite and the moment he gave it up he was fast asleep     chapter viii the east window   that diamond had fallen fast asleep is very evident from the strange things he now fancied as taking place for he thought he heard a sound as of whispering up in the great window he tried to open his eyes but he could not and the whispering went on and grew louder and louder until he could hear every word that was said he thought it was the apostles talking about him but he could not open his eyes  and how comes he to be lying there st peter said one  i think i saw him a while ago up in the gallery under the nicodemus window perhaps he has fallen down  what do you think st matthew  i don't think he could have crept here after falling from such a height he must have been killed  what are we to do with him we can't leave him lying there and we could not make him comfortable up here in the window  it's rather crowded already what do you say st thomas  let's go down and look at him  there came a rustling and a chinking for some time and then there was a silence and diamond felt somehow that all the apostles were standing round him and looking down on him and still he could not open his eyes  what is the matter with him st luke asked one  there's nothing the matter with him answered st luke who must have joined the company of the apostles from the next window one would think he's in a sound sleep  i have it cried another this is one of north wind's tricks she has caught him up and dropped him at our door like a withered leaf or a foundling baby i don't understand that woman's conduct i must say as if we hadn't enough to do with our money without going taking care of other people's children that's not what our forefathers built cathedrals for  now diamond could not bear to hear such things against north wind who he knew never played anybody a trick she was far too busy with her own work for that he struggled hard to open his eyes but without success  she should consider that a church is not a place for pranks not to mention that we live in it said another  it certainly is disrespectful of her but she always is disrespectful what right has she to bang at our windows as she has been doing the whole of this night i daresay there is glass broken somewhere i know my blue robe is in a dreadful mess with the rain first and the dust after it will cost me shillings to clean it  then diamond knew that they could not be apostles talking like this they could only be the sextons and vergers and such-like who got up at night and put on the robes of deans and bishops and called each other grand names as the foolish servants he had heard his father tell of call themselves lords and ladies after their masters and mistresses and he was so angry at their daring to abuse north wind that he jumped up crying north wind knows best what she is about she has a good right to blow the cobwebs from your windows for she was sent to do it she sweeps them away from grander places i can tell you for i've been with her at it  this was what he began to say but as he spoke his eyes came wide open and behold there were neither apostles nor vergers there not even a window with the effigies of holy men in it but a dark heap of hay all about him and the little panes in the roof of his loft glimmering blue in the light of the morning old diamond was coming awake down below in the stable in a moment more he was on his feet and shaking himself so that young diamond's bed trembled under him  he's grand at shaking himself said diamond i wish i could shake myself like that but then i can wash myself and he can't what fun it would be to see old diamond washing his face with his hoofs and iron shoes wouldn't it be a picture  so saying he got up and dressed himself then he went out into the garden there must have been a tremendous wind in the night for although all was quiet now there lay the little summer-house crushed to the ground and over it the great elm-tree which the wind had broken across being much decayed in the middle diamond almost cried to see the wilderness of green leaves which used to be so far up in the blue air tossing about in the breeze and liking it best when the wind blew it most now lying so near the ground and without any hope of ever getting up into the deep air again  i wonder how old the tree is thought diamond it must take a long time to get so near the sky as that poor tree was  yes indeed said a voice beside him for diamond had spoken the last words aloud  diamond started and looking around saw a clergyman a brother of mrs coleman who happened to be visiting her he was a great scholar and was in the habit of rising early  who are you my man he added  little diamond answered the boy  oh i have heard of you how do you come to be up so early  because the sham apostles talked such nonsense they waked me up  the clergyman stared diamond saw that he had better have held his tongue for he could not explain things  you must have been dreaming my little man said he dear dear he went on looking at the tree there has been terrible work here this is the north wind's doing what a pity i wish we lived at the back of it i'm sure  where is that sir asked diamond  away in the hyperborean regions answered the clergyman smiling  i never heard of the place returned diamond  i daresay not answered the clergyman but if this tree had been there now it would not have been blown down for there is no wind there  but please sir if it had been there said diamond we should not have had to be sorry for it  certainly not  then we shouldn't have had to be glad for it either  you're quite right my boy said the clergyman looking at him very kindly as he turned away to the house with his eyes bent towards the earth but diamond thought within himself i will ask north wind next time i see her to take me to that country i think she did speak about it once before     chapter ix how diamond got to the back of the north wind   when diamond went home to breakfast he found his father and mother already seated at the table they were both busy with their bread and butter and diamond sat himself down in his usual place his mother looked up at him and after watching him for a moment said   i don't think the boy is looking well husband  don't you well i don't know i think he looks pretty bobbish how do you feel yourself diamond my boy  quite well thank you father at least i think i've got a little headache  there i told you said his father and mother both at once  the child's very poorly added his mother  the child's quite well added his father  and then they both laughed  you see said his mother i've had a letter from my sister at sandwich  sleepy old hole said his father  don't abuse the place there's good people in it said his mother  right old lady returned his father only i don't believe there are more than two pair of carriage-horses in the whole blessed place  well people can get to heaven without carriages or coachmen either husband not that i should like to go without my coachman you know but about the boy  what boy  that boy there staring at you with his goggle-eyes  have i got goggle-eyes mother asked diamond a little dismayed  not too goggle said his mother who was quite proud of her boy's eyes only did not want to make him vain  not too goggle only you need not stare so  well what about him said his father  i told you i had got a letter  yes from your sister not from diamond  la husband you've got out of bed the wrong leg first this morning i do believe  i always get out with both at once said his father laughing  well listen then his aunt wants the boy to go down and see her  and that's why you want to make out that he ain't looking well  no more he is i think he had better go  well i don't care if you can find the money said his father  i'll manage that said his mother and so it was agreed that diamond should go to sandwich  i will not describe the preparations diamond made you would have thought he had been going on a three months' voyage nor will i describe the journey for our business is now at the place he was met at the station by his aunt a cheerful middle-aged woman and conveyed in safety to the sleepy old town as his father called it and no wonder that it was sleepy for it was nearly dead of old age  diamond went about staring with his beautiful goggle-eyes at the quaint old streets and the shops and the houses everything looked very strange indeed for here was a town abandoned by its nurse the sea like an old oyster left on the shore till it gaped for weariness it used to be one of the five chief seaports in england but it began to hold itself too high and the consequence was the sea grew less and less intimate with it gradually drew back and kept more to itself till at length it left it high and dry  sandwich was a seaport no more the sea went on with its own tide-business a long way off and forgot it of course it went to sleep and had no more to do with ships that's what comes to cities and nations and boys and girls who say i can do without your help i'm enough for myself  diamond soon made great friends with an old woman who kept a toyshop for his mother had given him twopence for pocket-money before he left and he had gone into her shop to spend it and she got talking to him she looked very funny because she had not got any teeth but diamond liked her and went often to her shop although he had nothing to spend there after the twopence was gone  one afternoon he had been wandering rather wearily about the streets for some time it was a hot day and he felt tired as he passed the toyshop he stepped in  please may i sit down for a minute on this box he said thinking the old woman was somewhere in the shop but he got no answer and sat down without one around him were a great many toys of all prices from a penny up to shillings all at once he heard a gentle whirring somewhere amongst them it made him start and look behind him there were the sails of a windmill going round and round almost close to his ear he thought at first it must be one of those toys which are wound up and go with clockwork but no it was a common penny toy with the windmill at the end of a whistle and when the whistle blows the windmill goes but the wonder was that there was no one at the whistle end blowing and yet the sails were turning round and round now faster now slower now faster again  what can it mean said diamond aloud  it means me said the tiniest voice he had ever heard  who are you please asked diamond  well really i begin to be ashamed of you said the voice i wonder how long it will be before you know me or how often i might take you in before you got sharp enough to suspect me you are as bad as a baby that doesn't know his mother in a new bonnet  not quite so bad as that dear north wind said diamond for i didn't see you at all and indeed i don't see you yet although i recognise your voice do grow a little please  not a hair's-breadth said the voice and it was the smallest voice that ever spoke what are you doing here  i am come to see my aunt but please north wind why didn't you come back for me in the church that night  i did i carried you safe home all the time you were dreaming about the glass apostles you were lying in my arms  i'm so glad said diamond i thought that must be it only i wanted to hear you say so did you sink the ship then  yes  and drown everybody  not quite one boat got away with six or seven men in it  how could the boat swim when the ship couldn't  of course i had some trouble with it i had to contrive a bit and manage the waves a little when they're once thoroughly waked up i have a good deal of trouble with them sometimes they're apt to get stupid with tumbling over each other's heads that's when they're fairly at it however the boat got to a desert island before noon next day  and what good will come of that  i don't know i obeyed orders good bye  oh stay north wind do stay cried diamond dismayed to see the windmill get slower and slower  what is it my dear child said north wind and the windmill began turning again so swiftly that diamond could scarcely see it what a big voice you've got and what a noise you do make with it what is it you want i have little to do but that little must be done  i want you to take me to the country at the back of the north wind  that's not so easy said north wind and was silent for so long that diamond thought she was gone indeed but after he had quite given her up the voice began again  i almost wish old herodotus had held his tongue about it much he knew of it  why do you wish that north wind  because then that clergyman would never have heard of it and set you wanting to go but we shall see we shall see you must go home now my dear for you don't seem very well and i'll see what can be done for you don't wait for me i've got to break a few of old goody's toys she's thinking too much of her new stock two or three will do there go now  diamond rose quite sorry and without a word left the shop and went home  it soon appeared that his mother had been right about him for that same afternoon his head began to ache very much and he had to go to bed  he awoke in the middle of the night the lattice window of his room had blown open and the curtains of his little bed were swinging about in the wind  if that should be north wind now thought diamond  but the next moment he heard some one closing the window and his aunt came to his bedside she put her hand on his face and said   how's your head dear  better auntie i think  would you like something to drink  oh yes i should please  so his aunt gave him some lemonade for she had been used to nursing sick people and diamond felt very much refreshed and laid his head down again to go very fast asleep as he thought and so he did but only to come awake again as a fresh burst of wind blew the lattice open a second time the same moment he found himself in a cloud of north wind's hair with her beautiful face set in it like a moon bending over him  quick diamond she said i have found such a chance  but i'm not well said diamond  i know that but you will be better for a little fresh air you shall have plenty of that  you want me to go then  yes i do it won't hurt you  very well said diamond and getting out of the bed-clothes he jumped into north wind's arms  we must make haste before your aunt comes said she as she glided out of the open lattice and left it swinging  the moment diamond felt her arms fold around him he began to feel better it was a moonless night and very dark with glimpses of stars when the clouds parted  i used to dash the waves about here said north wind where cows and sheep are feeding now but we shall soon get to them there they are  and diamond looking down saw the white glimmer of breaking water far below him  you see diamond said north wind it is very difficult for me to get you to the back of the north wind for that country lies in the very north itself and of course i can't blow northwards  why not asked diamond  you little silly said north wind don't you see that if i were to blow northwards i should be south wind and that is as much as to say that one person could be two persons  but how can you ever get home at all then  you are quite right that is my home though i never get farther than the outer door i sit on the doorstep and hear the voices inside i am nobody there diamond  i'm very sorry  why  that you should be nobody  oh i don't mind it dear little man you will be very glad some day to be nobody yourself but you can't understand that now and you had better not try for if you do you will be certain to go fancying some egregious nonsense and making yourself miserable about it  then i won't said diamond  there's a good boy it will all come in good time  but you haven't told me how you get to the doorstep you know  it is easy enough for me i have only to consent to be nobody and there i am i draw into myself and there i am on the doorstep but you can easily see or you have less sense than i think that to drag you you heavy thing along with me would take centuries and i could not give the time to it  oh i'm so sorry said diamond  what for now pet  that i'm so heavy for you i would be lighter if i could but i don't know how  you silly darling why i could toss you a hundred miles from me if i liked it is only when i am going home that i shall find you heavy  then you are going home with me  of course did i not come to fetch you just for that  but all this time you must be going southwards  yes of course i am  how can you be taking me northwards then  a very sensible question but you shall see i will get rid of a few of these clouds only they do come up so fast it's like trying to blow a brook dry there what do you see now  i think i see a little boat away there down below  a little boat indeed well she's a yacht of two hundred tons and the captain of it is a friend of mine for he is a man of good sense and can sail his craft well i've helped him many a time when he little thought it i've heard him grumbling at me when i was doing the very best i could for him why i've carried him eighty miles a day again and again right north  he must have dodged for that said diamond who had been watching the vessels and had seen that they went other ways than the wind blew  of course he must but don't you see it was the best i could do i couldn't be south wind and besides it gave him a share in the business it is not good at all mind that diamond to do everything for those you love and not give them a share in the doing it's not kind it's making too much of yourself my child if i had been south wind he would only have smoked his pipe all day and made himself stupid  but how could he be a man of sense and grumble at you when you were doing your best for him  oh you must make allowances said north wind or you will never do justice to anybody you do understand then that a captain may sail north    in spite of a north wind yes supplemented diamond  now i do think you must be stupid my dear said north wind suppose the north wind did not blow where would he be then  why then the south wind would carry him  so you think that when the north wind stops the south wind blows nonsense if i didn't blow the captain couldn't sail his eighty miles a day no doubt south wind would carry him faster but south wind is sitting on her doorstep then and if i stopped there would be a dead calm so you are all wrong to say he can sail north in spite of me he sails north by my help and my help alone you see that diamond  yes i do north wind i am stupid but i don't want to be stupid  good boy i am going to blow you north in that little craft one of the finest that ever sailed the sea here we are right over it i shall be blowing against you you will be sailing against me and all will be just as we want it the captain won't get on so fast as he would like but he will get on and so shall we i'm just going to put you on board do you see in front of the tiller that thing the man is working now to one side now to the other a round thing like the top of a drum  yes said diamond  below that is where they keep their spare sails and some stores of that sort i am going to blow that cover off the same moment i will drop you on deck and you must tumble in don't be afraid it is of no depth and you will fall on sail-cloth you will find it nice and warm and dry-only dark and you will know i am near you by every roll and pitch of the vessel coil yourself up and go to sleep the yacht shall be my cradle and you shall be my baby  thank you dear north wind i am not a bit afraid said diamond  in a moment they were on a level with the bulwarks and north wind sent the hatch of the after-store rattling away over the deck to leeward the next diamond found himself in the dark for he had tumbled through the hole as north wind had told him and the cover was replaced over his head away he went rolling to leeward for the wind began all at once to blow hard he heard the call of the captain and the loud trampling of the men over his head as they hauled at the main sheet to get the boom on board that they might take in a reef in the mainsail diamond felt about until he had found what seemed the most comfortable place and there he snuggled down and lay  hours after hours a great many of them went by and still diamond lay there he never felt in the least tired or impatient for a strange pleasure filled his heart the straining of the masts the creaking of the boom the singing of the ropes the banging of the blocks as they put the vessel about all fell in with the roaring of the wind above the surge of the waves past her sides and the thud with which every now and then one would strike her while through it all diamond could hear the gurgling rippling talking flow of the water against her planks as she slipped through it lying now on this side now on that like a subdued air running through the grand music his north wind was making about him to keep him from tiring as they sped on towards the country at the back of her doorstep  how long this lasted diamond had no idea he seemed to fall asleep sometimes only through the sleep he heard the sounds going on at length the weather seemed to get worse the confusion and trampling of feet grew more frequent over his head the vessel lay over more and more on her side and went roaring through the waves which banged and thumped at her as if in anger all at once arose a terrible uproar the hatch was blown off a cold fierce wind swept in upon him and a long arm came with it which laid hold of him and lifted him out the same moment he saw the little vessel far below him righting herself she had taken in all her sails and lay now tossing on the waves like a sea-bird with folded wings a short distance to the south lay a much larger vessel with two or three sails set and towards it north wind was carrying diamond it was a german ship on its way to the north pole  that vessel down there will give us a lift now said north wind and after that i must do the best i can  she managed to hide him amongst the flags of the big ship which were all snugly stowed away and on and on they sped towards the north at length one night she whispered in his ear come on deck diamond and he got up at once and crept on deck everything looked very strange here and there on all sides were huge masses of floating ice looking like cathedrals and castles and crags while away beyond was a blue sea  is the sun rising or setting asked diamond  neither or both which you please i can hardly tell which myself if he is setting now he will be rising the next moment  what a strange light it is said diamond i have heard that the sun doesn't go to bed all the summer in these parts miss coleman told me that i suppose he feels very sleepy and that is why the light he sends out looks so like a dream  that will account for it well enough for all practical purposes said north wind  some of the icebergs were drifting northwards one was passing very near the ship north wind seized diamond and with a single bound lighted on one of them a huge thing with sharp pinnacles and great clefts the same instant a wind began to blow from the south north wind hurried diamond down the north side of the iceberg stepping by its jags and splintering for this berg had never got far enough south to be melted and smoothed by the summer sun she brought him to a cave near the water where she entered and letting diamond go sat down as if weary on a ledge of ice  diamond seated himself on the other side and for a while was enraptured with the colour of the air inside the cave it was a deep dazzling lovely blue deeper than the deepest blue of the sky the blue seemed to be in constant motion like the blackness when you press your eyeballs with your fingers boiling and sparkling but when he looked across to north wind he was frightened her face was worn and livid  what is the matter with you dear north wind he said  nothing much i feel very faint but you mustn't mind it for i can bear it quite well south wind always blows me faint if it were not for the cool of the thick ice between me and her i should faint altogether indeed as it is i fear i must vanish  diamond stared at her in terror for he saw that her form and face were growing not small but transparent like something dissolving not in water but in light he could see the side of the blue cave through her very heart and she melted away till all that was left was a pale face like the moon in the morning with two great lucid eyes in it  i am going diamond she said  does it hurt you asked diamond  it's very uncomfortable she answered but i don't mind it for i shall come all right again before long i thought i should be able to go with you all the way but i cannot you must not be frightened though just go straight on and you will come all right you'll find me on the doorstep  as she spoke her face too faded quite away only diamond thought he could still see her eyes shining through the blue when he went closer however he found that what he thought her eyes were only two hollows in the ice north wind was quite gone and diamond would have cried if he had not trusted her so thoroughly so he sat still in the blue air of the cavern listening to the wash and ripple of the water all about the base of the iceberg as it sped on and on into the open sea northwards it was an excellent craft to go with the current for there was twice as much of it below water as above but a light south wind was blowing too and so it went fast  after a little while diamond went out and sat on the edge of his floating island and looked down into the ocean beneath him the white sides of the berg reflected so much light below the water that he could see far down into the green abyss sometimes he fancied he saw the eyes of north wind looking up at him from below but the fancy never lasted beyond the moment of its birth and the time passed he did not know how for he felt as if he were in a dream when he got tired of the green water he went into the blue cave and when he got tired of the blue cave he went out and gazed all about him on the blue sea ever sparkling in the sun which kept wheeling about the sky never going below the horizon but he chiefly gazed northwards to see whether any land were appearing all this time he never wanted to eat he broke off little bits of the berg now and then and sucked them and he thought them very nice  at length one time he came out of his cave he spied far off on the horizon a shining peak that rose into the sky like the top of some tremendous iceberg and his vessel was bearing him straight towards it as it went on the peak rose and rose higher and higher above the horizon and other peaks rose after it with sharp edges and jagged ridges connecting them diamond thought this must be the place he was going to and he was right for the mountains rose and rose till he saw the line of the coast at their feet and at length the iceberg drove into a little bay all around which were lofty precipices with snow on their tops and streaks of ice down their sides the berg floated slowly up to a projecting rock diamond stepped on shore and without looking behind him began to follow a natural path which led windingly towards the top of the precipice  when he reached it he found himself on a broad table of ice along which he could walk without much difficulty before him at a considerable distance rose a lofty ridge of ice which shot up into fantastic pinnacles and towers and battlements the air was very cold and seemed somehow dead for there was not the slightest breath of wind  in the centre of the ridge before him appeared a gap like the opening of a valley but as he walked towards it gazing and wondering whether that could be the way he had to take he saw that what had appeared a gap was the form of a woman seated against the ice front of the ridge leaning forwards with her hands in her lap and her hair hanging down to the ground  it is north wind on her doorstep said diamond joyfully and hurried on  he soon came up to the place and there the form sat like one of the great figures at the door of an egyptian temple motionless with drooping arms and head then diamond grew frightened because she did not move nor speak he was sure it was north wind but he thought she must be dead at last her face was white as the snow her eyes were blue as the air in the ice-cave and her hair hung down straight like icicles she had on a greenish robe like the colour in the hollows of a glacier seen from far off  he stood up before her and gazed fearfully into her face for a few minutes before he ventured to speak at length with a great effort and a trembling voice he faltered out   north wind  well child said the form without lifting its head  are you ill dear north wind  no i am waiting  what for  till i'm wanted  you don't care for me any more said diamond almost crying now  yes i do only i can't show it all my love is down at the bottom of my heart but i feel it bubbling there  what do you want me to do next dear north wind said diamond wishing to show his love by being obedient  what do you want to do yourself  i want to go into the country at your back  then you must go through me  i don't know what you mean  i mean just what i say you must walk on as if i were an open door and go right through me  but that will hurt you  not in the least it will hurt you though  i don't mind that if you tell me to do it  do it said north wind  diamond walked towards her instantly when he reached her knees he put out his hand to lay it on her but nothing was there save an intense cold he walked on then all grew white about him and the cold stung him like fire he walked on still groping through the whiteness it thickened about him at last it got into his heart and he lost all sense i would say that he fainted only whereas in common faints all grows black about you he felt swallowed up in whiteness it was when he reached north wind's heart that he fainted and fell but as he fell he rolled over the threshold and it was thus that diamond got to the back of the north wind     chapter x at the back of the north wind   i have now come to the most difficult part of my story and why because i do not know enough about it and why should i not know as much about this part as about any other part for of course i could know nothing about the story except diamond had told it and why should not diamond tell about the country at the back of the north wind as well as about his adventures in getting there because when he came back he had forgotten a great deal and what he did remember was very hard to tell things there are so different from things here the people there do not speak the same language for one thing indeed diamond insisted that there they do not speak at all i do not think he was right but it may well have appeared so to diamond the fact is we have different reports of the place from the most trustworthy people therefore we are bound to believe that it appears somewhat different to different people all however agree in a general way about it  i will tell you something of what two very different people have reported both of whom knew more about it i believe than herodotus one of them speaks from his own experience for he visited the country the other from the testimony of a young peasant girl who came back from it for a month's visit to her friends the former was a great italian of noble family who died more than five hundred years ago the latter a scotch shepherd who died not forty years ago  the italian then informs us that he had to enter that country through a fire so hot that he would have thrown himself into boiling glass to cool himself this was not diamond's experience but then durante that was the name of the italian and it means lasting for his books will last as long as there are enough men in the world worthy of having them durante was an elderly man and diamond was a little boy and so their experience must be a little different the peasant girl on the other hand fell fast asleep in a wood and woke in the same country  in describing it durante says that the ground everywhere smelt sweetly and that a gentle even-tempered wind which never blew faster or slower breathed in his face as he went making all the leaves point one way not so as to disturb the birds in the tops of the trees but on the contrary sounding a bass to their song he describes also a little river which was so full that its little waves as it hurried along bent the grass full of red and yellow flowers through which it flowed he says that the purest stream in the world beside this one would look as if it were mixed with something that did not belong to it even although it was flowing ever in the brown shadow of the trees and neither sun nor moon could shine upon it he seems to imply that it is always the month of may in that country it would be out of place to describe here the wonderful sights he saw for the music of them is in another key from that of this story and i shall therefore only add from the account of this traveller that the people there are so free and so just and so healthy that every one of them has a crown like a king and a mitre like a priest  the peasant girl kilmeny was her name could not report such grand things as durante for as the shepherd says telling her story as i tell diamond's              kilmeny had been she knew not where            and kilmeny had seen what she could not declare            kilmeny had been where the cock never crew            where the rain never fell and the wind never blew            but it seemed as the harp of the sky had rung            and the airs of heaven played round her tongue            when she spoke of the lovely forms she had seen            and a land where sin had never been            a land of love and a land of light            withouten sun or moon or night            where the river swayed a living stream            and the light a pure and cloudless beam             the land of vision it would seem            and still an everlasting dream   the last two lines are the shepherd's own remark and a matter of opinion but it is clear i think that kilmeny must have described the same country as durante saw though not having his experience she could neither understand nor describe it so well  now i must give you such fragments of recollection as diamond was able to bring back with him  when he came to himself after he fell he found himself at the back of the north wind north wind herself was nowhere to be seen neither was there a vestige of snow or of ice within sight the sun too had vanished but that was no matter for there was plenty of a certain still rayless light where it came from he never found out but he thought it belonged to the country itself sometimes he thought it came out of the flowers which were very bright but had no strong colour he said the river for all agree that there is a river there flowed not only through but over grass  its channel instead of being rock stones pebbles sand or anything else was of pure meadow grass not over long he insisted that if it did not sing tunes in people's ears it sung tunes in their heads in proof of which i may mention that in the troubles which followed diamond was often heard singing and when asked what he was singing would answer one of the tunes the river at the back of the north wind sung and i may as well say at once that diamond never told these things to any one but no i had better not say who it was but whoever it was told me and i thought it would be well to write them for my child-readers  he could not say he was very happy there for he had neither his father nor mother with him but he felt so still and quiet and patient and contented that as far as the mere feeling went it was something better than mere happiness nothing went wrong at the back of the north wind neither was anything quite right he thought only everything was going to be right some day his account disagreed with that of durante and agreed with that of kilmeny in this that he protested there was no wind there at all i fancy he missed it at all events we could not do without wind it all depends on how big our lungs are whether the wind is too strong for us or not  when the person he told about it asked him whether he saw anybody he knew there he answered only a little girl belonging to the gardener who thought he had lost her but was quite mistaken for there she was safe enough and was to come back some day as i came back if they would only wait  did you talk to her diamond  no nobody talks there they only look at each other and understand everything  is it cold there  no  is it hot  no  what is it then  you never think about such things there  what a queer place it must be  it's a very good place  do you want to go back again  no i don't think i have left it i feel it here somewhere  did the people there look pleased  yes quite pleased only a little sad  then they didn't look glad  they looked as if they were waiting to be gladder some day  this was how diamond used to answer questions about that country and now i will take up the story again and tell you how he got back to this country     chapter xi how diamond got home again   when one at the back of the north wind wanted to know how things were going with any one he loved he had to go to a certain tree climb the stem and sit down in the branches in a few minutes if he kept very still he would see something at least of what was going on with the people he loved  one day when diamond was sitting in this tree he began to long very much to get home again and no wonder for he saw his mother crying durante says that the people there may always follow their wishes because they never wish but what is good diamond's wish was to get home and he would fain follow his wish  but how was he to set about it if he could only see north wind but the moment he had got to her back she was gone altogether from his sight he had never seen her back she might be sitting on her doorstep still looking southwards and waiting white and thin and blue-eyed until she was wanted or she might have again become a mighty creature with power to do that which was demanded of her and gone far away upon many missions she must be somewhere however he could not go home without her and therefore he must find her she could never have intended to leave him always away from his mother if there had been any danger of that she would have told him and given him his choice about going for north wind was right honest how to find north wind therefore occupied all his thoughts  in his anxiety about his mother he used to climb the tree every day and sit in its branches however many of the dwellers there did so they never incommoded one another for the moment one got into the tree he became invisible to every one else and it was such a wide-spreading tree that there was room for every one of the people of the country in it without the least interference with each other sometimes on getting down two of them would meet at the root and then they would smile to each other more sweetly than at any other time as much as to say ah you've been up there too  one day he was sitting on one of the outer branches of the tree looking southwards after his home far away was a blue shining sea dotted with gleaming and sparkling specks of white those were the icebergs nearer he saw a great range of snow-capped mountains and down below him the lovely meadow-grass of the country with the stream flowing and flowing through it away towards the sea as he looked he began to wonder for the whole country lay beneath him like a map and that which was near him looked just as small as that which he knew to be miles away the ridge of ice which encircled it appeared but a few yards off and no larger than the row of pebbles with which a child will mark out the boundaries of the kingdom he has appropriated on the sea-shore he thought he could distinguish the vapoury form of north wind seated as he had left her on the other side hastily he descended the tree and to his amazement found that the map or model of the country still lay at his feet he stood in it with one stride he had crossed the river with another he had reached the ridge of ice with the third he stepped over its peaks and sank wearily down at north wind's knees for there she sat on her doorstep the peaks of the great ridge of ice were as lofty as ever behind her and the country at her back had vanished from diamond's view  north wind was as still as diamond had left her her pale face was white as the snow and her motionless eyes were as blue as the caverns in the ice but the instant diamond touched her her face began to change like that of one waking from sleep light began to glimmer from the blue of her eyes  a moment more and she laid her hand on diamond's head and began playing with his hair diamond took hold of her hand and laid his face to it she gave a little start  how very alive you are child she murmured come nearer to me  by the help of the stones all around he clambered up beside her and laid himself against her bosom she gave a great sigh slowly lifted her arms and slowly folded them about him until she clasped him close yet a moment and she roused herself and came quite awake and the cold of her bosom which had pierced diamond's bones vanished  have you been sitting here ever since i went through you dear north wind asked diamond stroking her hand  yes she answered looking at him with her old kindness  ain't you very tired  no i've often had to sit longer do you know how long you have been  oh years and years answered diamond  you have just been seven days returned north wind  i thought i had been a hundred years exclaimed diamond  yes i daresay replied north wind you've been away from here seven days but how long you may have been in there is quite another thing behind my back and before my face things are so different they don't go at all by the same rule  i'm very glad said diamond after thinking a while  why asked north wind  because i've been such a long time there and such a little while away from mother why she won't be expecting me home from sandwich yet  no but we mustn't talk any longer i've got my orders now and we must be off in a few minutes  next moment diamond found himself sitting alone on the rock north wind had vanished a creature like a great humble-bee or cockchafer flew past his face but it could be neither for there were no insects amongst the ice it passed him again and again flying in circles around him and he concluded that it must be north wind herself no bigger than tom thumb when his mother put him in the nutshell lined with flannel but she was no longer vapoury and thin she was solid although tiny a moment more and she perched on his shoulder  come along diamond she said in his ear in the smallest and highest of treble voices it is time we were setting out for sandwich  diamond could just see her by turning his head towards his shoulder as far as he could but only with one eye for his nose came between her and the other  won't you take me in your arms and carry me he said in a whisper for he knew she did not like a loud voice when she was small  ah you ungrateful boy returned north wind smiling how dare you make game of me yes i will carry you but you shall walk a bit for your impertinence first come along  she jumped from his shoulder but when diamond looked for her upon the ground he could see nothing but a little spider with long legs that made its way over the ice towards the south it ran very fast indeed for a spider but diamond ran a long way before it and then waited for it it was up with him sooner than he had expected however and it had grown a good deal and the spider grew and grew and went faster and faster till all at once diamond discovered that it was not a spider but a weasel and away glided the weasel and away went diamond after it and it took all the run there was in him to keep up with the weasel and the weasel grew and grew and grew till all at once diamond saw that the weasel was not a weasel but a cat and away went the cat and diamond after it and when he had run half a mile he found the cat waiting for him sitting up and washing her face not to lose time and away went the cat again and diamond after it but the next time he came up with the cat the cat was not a cat but a hunting-leopard and the hunting-leopard grew to a jaguar all covered with spots like eyes and the jaguar grew to a bengal tiger and at none of them was diamond afraid for he had been at north wind's back and he could be afraid of her no longer whatever she did or grew and the tiger flew over the snow in a straight line for the south growing less and less to diamond's eyes till it was only a black speck upon the whiteness and then it vanished altogether and now diamond felt that he would rather not run any farther and that the ice had got very rough besides he was near the precipices that bounded the sea so he slackened his pace to a walk saying aloud to himself   when north wind has punished me enough for making game of her she will come back to me i know she will for i can't go much farther without her  you dear boy it was only in fun here i am said north wind's voice behind him  diamond turned and saw her as he liked best to see her standing beside him a tall lady  where's the tiger he asked for he knew all the creatures from a picture book that miss coleman had given him but of course he added you were the tiger i was puzzled and forgot i saw it such a long way off before me and there you were behind me it's so odd you know  it must look very odd to you diamond  i see that but it is no more odd to me than to break an old pine in two  well that's odd enough remarked diamond  so it is i forgot well none of these things are odder to me than it is to you to eat bread and butter  well that's odd too when i think of it persisted diamond i should just like a slice of bread and butter i'm afraid to say how long it is how long it seems to me that is since i had anything to eat  come then said north wind stooping and holding out her arms you shall have some bread and butter very soon i am glad to find you want some  diamond held up his arms to meet hers and was safe upon her bosom north wind bounded into the air her tresses began to lift and rise and spread and stream and flow and flutter and with a roar from her hair and an answering roar from one of the great glaciers beside them whose slow torrent tumbled two or three icebergs at once into the waves at their feet north wind and diamond went flying southwards     chapter xii who met diamond at sandwich   as they flew so fast they went that the sea slid away from under them like a great web of shot silk blue shot with grey and green shot with purple they went so fast that the stars themselves appeared to sail away past them overhead like golden boats on a blue sea turned upside down and they went so fast that diamond himself went the other way as fast i mean he went fast asleep in north wind's arms  when he woke a face was bending over him but it was not north wind's it was his mother's he put out his arms to her and she clasped him to her bosom and burst out crying diamond kissed her again and again to make her stop perhaps kissing is the best thing for crying but it will not always stop it  what is the matter mother he said  oh diamond my darling you have been so ill she sobbed  no mother dear i've only been at the back of the north wind  returned diamond  i thought you were dead said his mother  but that moment the doctor came in  oh there said the doctor with gentle cheerfulness we're better to-day i see  then he drew the mother aside and told her not to talk to diamond or to mind what he might say for he must be kept as quiet as possible and indeed diamond was not much inclined to talk for he felt very strange and weak which was little wonder seeing that all the time he had been away he had only sucked a few lumps of ice and there could not be much nourishment in them  now while he is lying there getting strong again with chicken broth and other nice things i will tell my readers what had been taking place at his home for they ought to be told it  they may have forgotten that miss coleman was in a very poor state of health now there were three reasons for this in the first place her lungs were not strong in the second place there was a gentleman somewhere who had not behaved very well to her in the third place she had not anything particular to do these three nots together are enough to make a lady very ill indeed of course she could not help the first cause but if the other two causes had not existed that would have been of little consequence she would only have to be a little careful the second she could not help quite but if she had had anything to do and had done it well it would have been very difficult for any man to behave badly to her and for this third cause of her illness if she had had anything to do that was worth doing she might have borne his bad behaviour so that even that would not have made her ill it is not always easy i confess to find something to do that is worth doing but the most difficult things are constantly being done and she might have found something if she had tried her fault lay in this that she had not tried but to be sure her father and mother were to blame that they had never set her going only then again nobody had told her father and mother that they ought to set her going in that direction so as none of them would find it out of themselves north wind had to teach them  we know that north wind was very busy that night on which she left diamond in the cathedral she had in a sense been blowing through and through the colemans' house the whole of the night first miss coleman's maid had left a chink of her mistress's window open thinking she had shut it and north wind had wound a few of her hairs round the lady's throat she was considerably worse the next morning again the ship which north wind had sunk that very night belonged to mr coleman nor will my readers understand what a heavy loss this was to him until i have informed them that he had been getting poorer and poorer for some time he was not so successful in his speculations as he had been for he speculated a great deal more than was right and it was time he should be pulled up it is a hard thing for a rich man to grow poor but it is an awful thing for him to grow dishonest and some kinds of speculation lead a man deep into dishonesty before he thinks what he is about poverty will not make a man worthless he may be worth a great deal more when he is poor than he was when he was rich but dishonesty goes very far indeed to make a man of no value a thing to be thrown out in the dust-hole of the creation like a bit of a broken basin or a dirty rag so north wind had to look after mr coleman and try to make an honest man of him so she sank the ship which was his last venture and he was what himself and his wife and the world called ruined  nor was this all yet for on board that vessel miss coleman's lover was a passenger and when the news came that the vessel had gone down and that all on board had perished we may be sure she did not think the loss of their fine house and garden and furniture the greatest misfortune in the world  of course the trouble did not end with mr coleman and his family nobody can suffer alone when the cause of suffering is most deeply hidden in the heart and nobody knows anything about it but the man himself he must be a great and a good man indeed such as few of us have known if the pain inside him does not make him behave so as to cause all about him to be more or less uncomfortable but when a man brings money-troubles on himself by making haste to be rich then most of the people he has to do with must suffer in the same way with himself the elm-tree which north wind blew down that very night as if small and great trials were to be gathered in one heap crushed miss coleman's pretty summer-house  just so the fall of mr coleman crushed the little family that lived over his coach-house and stable before diamond was well enough to be taken home there was no home for him to go to mr coleman or his creditors for i do not know the particulars had sold house carriage horses furniture and everything he and his wife and daughter and mrs crump had gone to live in a small house in hoxton where he would be unknown and whence he could walk to his place of business in the city for he was not an old man and hoped yet to retrieve his fortunes let us hope that he lived to retrieve his honesty the tail of which had slipped through his fingers to the very last joint if not beyond it  of course diamond's father had nothing to do for a time but it was not so hard for him to have nothing to do as it was for miss coleman he wrote to his wife that if her sister would keep her there till he got a place it would be better for them and he would be greatly obliged to her meantime the gentleman who had bought the house had allowed his furniture to remain where it was for a little while  diamond's aunt was quite willing to keep them as long as she could and indeed diamond was not yet well enough to be moved with safety  when he had recovered so far as to be able to go out one day his mother got her sister's husband who had a little pony-cart to carry them down to the sea-shore and leave them there for a few hours he had some business to do further on at ramsgate and would pick them up as he returned a whiff of the sea-air would do them both good she said and she thought besides she could best tell diamond what had happened if she had him quite to herself     chapter xiii the seaside   diamond and his mother sat down upon the edge of the rough grass that bordered the sand the sun was just far enough past its highest not to shine in their eyes when they looked eastward a sweet little wind blew on their left side and comforted the mother without letting her know what it was that comforted her away before them stretched the sparkling waters of the ocean every wave of which flashed out its own delight back in the face of the great sun which looked down from the stillness of its blue house with glorious silent face upon its flashing children on each hand the shore rounded outwards forming a little bay there were no white cliffs here as further north and south and the place was rather dreary but the sky got at them so much the better not a house not a creature was within sight dry sand was about their feet and under them thin wiry grass that just managed to grow out of the poverty-stricken shore  oh dear said diamond's mother with a deep sigh it's a sad world  is it said diamond i didn't know  how should you know child you've been too well taken care of i trust  oh yes i have returned diamond i'm sorry i thought you were taken care of too i thought my father took care of you i will ask him about it i think he must have forgotten  dear boy said his mother your father's the best man in the world  so i thought returned diamond with triumph i was sure of it well doesn't he take very good care of you  yes yes he does answered his mother bursting into tears but who's to take care of him and how is he to take care of us if he's got nothing to eat himself  oh dear said diamond with a gasp hasn't he got anything to eat oh i must go home to him  no no child he's not come to that yet but what's to become of us i don't know  are you very hungry mother there's the basket i thought you put something to eat in it  o you darling stupid i didn't say i was hungry returned his mother smiling through her tears  then i don't understand you at all said diamond do tell me what's the matter  there are people in the world who have nothing to eat diamond  then i suppose they don't stop in it any longer they they what you call die don't they  yes they do how would you like that  i don't know i never tried but i suppose they go where they get something to eat  like enough they don't want it said his mother petulantly  that's all right then said diamond thinking i daresay more than he chose to put in words  is it though poor boy how little you know about things mr coleman's lost all his money and your father has nothing to do and we shall have nothing to eat by and by  are you sure mother  sure of what  sure that we shall have nothing to eat  no thank heaven i'm not sure of it i hope not  then i can't understand it mother there's a piece of gingerbread in the basket i know  o you little bird you have no more sense than a sparrow that picks what it wants and never thinks of the winter and the frost and the snow  ah yes i see but the birds get through the winter don't they  some of them fall dead on the ground  they must die some time they wouldn't like to be birds always would you mother  what a child it is thought his mother but she said nothing  oh now i remember diamond went on father told me that day i went to epping forest with him that the rose-bushes and the may-bushes and the holly-bushes were the bird's barns for there were the hips and the haws and the holly-berries all ready for the winter  yes that's all very true so you see the birds are provided for but there are no such barns for you and me diamond  ain't there  no we've got to work for our bread  then let's go and work said diamond getting up  it's no use we've not got anything to do  then let's wait  then we shall starve  no there's the basket do you know mother i think i shall call that basket the barn  it's not a very big one and when it's empty where are we then  at auntie's cupboard returned diamond promptly  but we can't eat auntie's things all up and leave her to starve  no no we'll go back to father before that he'll have found a cupboard somewhere by that time  how do you know that  i don't know it but i haven't got even a cupboard and i've always had plenty to eat i've heard you say i had too much sometimes  but i tell you that's because i've had a cupboard for you child  and when yours was empty auntie opened hers  but that can't go on  how do you know i think there must be a big cupboard somewhere out of which the little cupboards are filled you know mother  well i wish i could find the door of that cupboard said his mother but the same moment she stopped and was silent for a good while i cannot tell whether diamond knew what she was thinking but i think i know she had heard something at church the day before which came back upon her something like this that she hadn't to eat for tomorrow as well as for to-day and that what was not wanted couldn't be missed so instead of saying anything more she stretched out her hand for the basket and she and diamond had their dinner  and diamond did enjoy it for the drive and the fresh air had made him quite hungry and he did not like his mother trouble himself about what they should dine off that day week the fact was he had lived so long without any food at all at the back of the north wind that he knew quite well that food was not essential to existence that in fact under certain circumstances people could live without it well enough  his mother did not speak much during their dinner after it was over she helped him to walk about a little but he was not able for much and soon got tired he did not get fretful though he was too glad of having the sun and the wind again to fret because he could not run about he lay down on the dry sand and his mother covered him with a shawl she then sat by his side and took a bit of work from her pocket but diamond felt rather sleepy and turned on his side and gazed sleepily over the sand a few yards off he saw something fluttering  what is that mother he said  only a bit of paper she answered  it flutters more than a bit of paper would i think said diamond  i'll go and see if you like said his mother my eyes are none of the best  so she rose and went and found that they were both right for it was a little book partly buried in the sand but several of its leaves were clear of the sand and these the wind kept blowing about in a very flutterful manner she took it up and brought it to diamond  what is it mother he asked  some nursery rhymes i think she answered  i'm too sleepy said diamond do read some of them to me  yes i will she said and began one but this is such nonsense  she said again i will try to find a better one  she turned the leaves searching but three times with sudden puffs the wind blew the leaves rustling back to the same verses  do read that one said diamond who seemed to be of the same mind as the wind it sounded very nice i am sure it is a good one  so his mother thought it might amuse him though she couldn't find any sense in it she never thought he might understand it although she could not  now i do not exactly know what the mother read but this is what diamond heard or thought afterwards that he had heard he was however as i have said very sleepy and when he thought he understood the verses he may have been only dreaming better ones this is how they went   i know a river whose waters run asleep run run ever singing in the shallows dumb in the hollows sleeping so deep and all the swallows that dip their feathers in the hollows or in the shallows are the merriest swallows of all for the nests they bake with the clay they cake with the water they shake from their wings that rake the water out of the shallows or the hollows will hold together in any weather and so the swallows are the merriest fellows and have the merriest children and are built so narrow like the head of an arrow to cut the air and go just where the nicest water is flowing and the nicest dust is blowing for each so narrow like head of an arrow is only a barrow to carry the mud he makes from the nicest water flowing and the nicest dust that is blowing to build his nest for her he loves best with the nicest cakes which the sunshine bakes all for their merry children all so callow with beaks that follow gaping and hollow wider and wider after their father or after their mother the food-provider who brings them a spider or a worm the poor hider down in the earth so there's no dearth for their beaks as yellow as the buttercups growing beside the flowing of the singing river always and ever growing and blowing for fast as the sheep awake or asleep crop them and crop them they cannot stop them but up they creep and on they go blowing and so with the daisies the little white praises they grow and they blow and they spread out their crown and they praise the sun and when he goes down their praising is done and they fold up their crown and they sleep every one till over the plain he's shining amain and they're at it again praising and praising such low songs raising that no one hears them but the sun who rears them and the sheep that bite them are the quietest sheep awake or asleep with the merriest bleat and the little lambs are the merriest lambs they forget to eat for the frolic in their feet and the lambs and their dams are the whitest sheep with the woolliest wool and the longest wool and the trailingest tails and they shine like snow in the grasses that grow by the singing river that sings for ever and the sheep and the lambs are merry for ever because the river sings and they drink it and the lambs and their dams are quiet and white because of their diet for what they bite is buttercups yellow and daisies white and grass as green as the river can make it with wind as mellow to kiss it and shake it as never was seen but here in the hollows beside the river where all the swallows are merriest of fellows for the nests they make with the clay they cake in the sunshine bake till they are like bone as dry in the wind as a marble stone so firm they bind the grass in the clay that dries in the wind the sweetest wind that blows by the river flowing for ever but never you find whence comes the wind that blows on the hollows and over the shallows where dip the swallows alive it blows the life as it goes awake or asleep into the river that sings as it flows and the life it blows into the sheep awake or asleep with the woolliest wool and the trailingest tails and it never fails gentle and cool to wave the wool and to toss the grass as the lambs and the sheep over it pass and tug and bite with their teeth so white and then with the sweep of their trailing tails smooth it again and it grows amain and amain it grows and the wind as it blows tosses the swallows over the hollows and down on the shallows till every feather doth shake and quiver and all their feathers go all together blowing the life and the joy so rife into the swallows that skim the shallows and have the yellowest children for the wind that blows is the life of the river flowing for ever that washes the grasses still as it passes and feeds the daisies the little white praises and buttercups bonny so golden and sunny with butter and honey that whiten the sheep awake or asleep that nibble and bite and grow whiter than white and merry and quiet on the sweet diet fed by the river and tossed for ever by the wind that tosses the swallow that crosses over the shallows dipping his wings to gather the water and bake the cake that the wind shall make as hard as a bone as dry as a stone it's all in the wind that blows from behind and all in the river that flows for ever and all in the grasses and the white daisies and the merry sheep awake or asleep and the happy swallows skimming the shallows and it's all in the wind that blows from behind   here diamond became aware that his mother had stopped reading  why don't you go on mother dear he asked  it's such nonsense said his mother i believe it would go on for ever  that's just what it did said diamond  what did she asked  why the river that's almost the very tune it used to sing  his mother was frightened for she thought the fever was coming on again so she did not contradict him  who made that poem asked diamond  i don't know she answered some silly woman for her children i suppose and then thought it good enough to print  she must have been at the back of the north wind some time or other anyhow said diamond she couldn't have got a hold of it anywhere else that's just how it went and he began to chant bits of it here and there but his mother said nothing for fear of making him worse and she was very glad indeed when she saw her brother-in-law jogging along in his little cart they lifted diamond in and got up themselves and away they went home again home again home again as diamond sang but he soon grew quiet and before they reached sandwich he was fast asleep and dreaming of the country at the back of the north wind     chapter xiv old diamond   after this diamond recovered so fast that in a few days he was quite able to go home as soon as his father had a place for them to go now his father having saved a little money and finding that no situation offered itself had been thinking over a new plan a strange occurrence it was which turned his thoughts in that direction he had a friend in the bloomsbury region who lived by letting out cabs and horses to the cabmen this man happening to meet him one day as he was returning from an unsuccessful application said to him   why don't you set up for yourself now in the cab line i mean  i haven't enough for that answered diamond's father  you must have saved a goodish bit i should think just come home with me now and look at a horse i can let you have cheap i bought him only a few weeks ago thinking he'd do for a hansom but i was wrong he's got bone enough for a waggon but a waggon ain't a hansom he ain't got go enough for a hansom you see parties as takes hansoms wants to go like the wind and he ain't got wind enough for he ain't so young as he once was but for a four-wheeler as takes families and their luggages he's the very horse he'd carry a small house any day i bought him cheap and i'll sell him cheap  oh i don't want him said diamond's father a body must have time to think over an affair of so much importance and there's the cab too that would come to a deal of money  i could fit you there i daresay said his friend but come and look at the animal anyhow  since i lost my own old pair as was mr coleman's said diamond's father turning to accompany the cab-master i ain't almost got the heart to look a horse in the face it's a thousand pities to part man and horse  so it is returned his friend sympathetically  but what was the ex-coachman's delight when on going into the stable where his friend led him he found the horse he wanted him to buy was no other than his own old diamond grown very thin and bony and long-legged as if they had been doing what they could to fit him for hansom work  he ain't a hansom horse said diamond's father indignantly  well you're right he ain't handsome but he's a good un said his owner  who says he ain't handsome he's one of the handsomest horses a gentleman's coachman ever druv said diamond's father remarking to himself under his breath though i says it as shouldn't for he did not feel inclined all at once to confess that his own old horse could have sunk so low  well said his friend all i say is there's a animal for you as strong as a church an'll go like a train leastways a parly he added correcting himself  but the coachman had a lump in his throat and tears in his eyes for the old horse hearing his voice had turned his long neck and when his old friend went up to him and laid his hand on his side he whinnied for joy and laid his big head on his master's breast this settled the matter the coachman's arms were round the horse's neck in a moment and he fairly broke down and cried the cab-master had never been so fond of a horse himself as to hug him like that but he saw in a moment how it was and he must have been a good-hearted fellow for i never heard of such an idea coming into the head of any other man with a horse to sell  instead of putting something on to the price because he was now pretty sure of selling him he actually took a pound off what he had meant to ask for him saying to himself it was a shame to part old friends  diamond's father as soon as he came to himself turned and asked how much he wanted for the horse  i see you're old friends said the owner  it's my own old diamond i liked him far the best of the pair though the other was good you ain't got him too have you  no nothing in the stable to match him there  i believe you said the coachman but you'll be wanting a long price for him i know  no not so much i bought him cheap and as i say he ain't for my work  the end of it was that diamond's father bought old diamond again along with a four-wheeled cab and as there were some rooms to be had over the stable he took them wrote to his wife to come home and set up as a cabman     chapter xv the mews   it was late in the afternoon when diamond and his mother and the baby reached london i was so full of diamond that i forgot to tell you a baby had arrived in the meantime his father was waiting for them with his own cab but they had not told diamond who the horse was for his father wanted to enjoy the pleasure of his surprise when he found it out he got in with his mother without looking at the horse and his father having put up diamond's carpet-bag and his mother's little trunk got upon the box himself and drove off and diamond was quite proud of riding home in his father's own carriage but when he got to the mews he could not help being a little dismayed at first and if he had never been to the back of the north wind i am afraid he would have cried a little but instead of that he said to himself it was a fine thing all the old furniture was there and instead of helping his mother to be miserable at the change he began to find out all the advantages of the place for every place has some advantages and they are always better worth knowing than the disadvantages certainly the weather was depressing for a thick dull persistent rain was falling by the time they reached home but happily the weather is very changeable and besides there was a good fire burning in the room which their neighbour with the drunken husband had attended to for them and the tea-things were put out and the kettle was boiling on the fire and with a good fire and tea and bread and butter things cannot be said to be miserable  diamond's father and mother were notwithstanding rather miserable and diamond began to feel a kind of darkness beginning to spread over his own mind but the same moment he said to himself this will never do i can't give in to this i've been to the back of the north wind things go right there and so i must try to get things to go right here i've got to fight the miserable things they shan't make me miserable if i can help it i do not mean that he thought these very words they are perhaps too grown-up for him to have thought but they represent the kind of thing that was in his heart and his head and when heart and head go together nothing can stand before them  what nice bread and butter this is said diamond  i'm glad you like it my dear said his father i bought the butter myself at the little shop round the corner  it's very nice thank you father oh there's baby waking i'll take him  sit still diamond said his mother go on with your bread and butter you're not strong enough to lift him yet  so she took the baby herself and set him on her knee then diamond began to amuse him and went on till the little fellow was shrieking with laughter for the baby's world was his mother's arms and the drizzling rain and the dreary mews and even his father's troubled face could not touch him what cared baby for the loss of a hundred situations yet neither father nor mother thought him hard-hearted because he crowed and laughed in the middle of their troubles on the contrary his crowing and laughing were infectious his little heart was so full of merriment that it could not hold it all and it ran over into theirs father and mother began to laugh too and diamond laughed till he had a fit of coughing which frightened his mother and made them all stop his father took the baby and his mother put him to bed  but it was indeed a change to them all not only from sandwich but from their old place instead of the great river where the huge barges with their mighty brown and yellow sails went tacking from side to side like little pleasure-skiffs and where the long thin boats shot past with eight and sometimes twelve rowers their windows now looked out upon a dirty paved yard and there was no garden more for diamond to run into when he pleased with gay flowers about his feet and solemn sun-filled trees over his head neither was there a wooden wall at the back of his bed with a hole in it for north wind to come in at when she liked indeed there was such a high wall and there were so many houses about the mews that north wind seldom got into the place at all except when something must be done and she had a grand cleaning out like other housewives while the partition at the head of diamond's new bed only divided it from the room occupied by a cabman who drank too much beer and came home chiefly to quarrel with his wife and pinch his children it was dreadful to diamond to hear the scolding and the crying but it could not make him miserable because he had been at the back of the north wind  if my reader find it hard to believe that diamond should be so good he must remember that he had been to the back of the north wind if he never knew a boy so good did he ever know a boy that had been to the back of the north wind it was not in the least strange of diamond to behave as he did on the contrary it was thoroughly sensible of him  we shall see how he got on     chapter xvi diamond makes a beginning   the wind blew loud but diamond slept a deep sleep and never heard it my own impression is that every time when diamond slept well and remembered nothing about it in the morning he had been all that night at the back of the north wind i am almost sure that was how he woke so refreshed and felt so quiet and hopeful all the day indeed he said this much though not to me that always when he woke from such a sleep there was a something in his mind he could not tell what could not tell whether it was the last far-off sounds of the river dying away in the distance or some of the words of the endless song his mother had read to him on the sea-shore sometimes he thought it must have been the twittering of the swallows over the shallows you know but it may have been the chirping of the dingy sparrows picking up their breakfast in the yard how can i tell i don't know what i know i only know what i think and to tell the truth i am more for the swallows than the sparrows when he knew he was coming awake he would sometimes try hard to keep hold of the words of what seemed a new song one he had not heard before a song in which the words and the music somehow appeared to be all one but even when he thought he had got them well fixed in his mind ever as he came awaker as he would say one line faded away out of it and then another and then another till at last there was nothing left but some lovely picture of water or grass or daisies or something else very common but with all the commonness polished off it and the lovely soul of it which people so seldom see and alas yet seldomer believe in shining out but after that he would sing the oddest loveliest little songs to the baby of his own making his mother said but diamond said he did not make them they were made somewhere inside him and he knew nothing about them till they were coming out  when he woke that first morning he got up at once saying to himself i've been ill long enough and have given a great deal of trouble i must try and be of use now and help my mother when he went into her room he found her lighting the fire and his father just getting out of bed they had only the one room besides the little one not much more than a closet in which diamond slept he began at once to set things to rights but the baby waking up he took him and nursed him till his mother had got the breakfast ready she was looking gloomy and his father was silent and indeed except diamond had done all he possibly could to keep out the misery that was trying to get in at doors and windows he too would have grown miserable and then they would have been all miserable together but to try to make others comfortable is the only way to get right comfortable ourselves and that comes partly of not being able to think so much about ourselves when we are helping other people for our selves will always do pretty well if we don't pay them too much attention our selves are like some little children who will be happy enough so long as they are left to their own games but when we begin to interfere with them and make them presents of too nice playthings or too many sweet things they begin at once to fret and spoil  why diamond child said his mother at last you're as good to your mother as if you were a girl nursing the baby and toasting the bread and sweeping up the hearth i declare a body would think you had been among the fairies  could diamond have had greater praise or greater pleasure you see when he forgot his self his mother took care of his self and loved and praised his self our own praises poison our selves and puff and swell them up till they lose all shape and beauty and become like great toadstools but the praises of father or mother do our selves good and comfort them and make them beautiful they never do them any harm if they do any harm it comes of our mixing some of our own praises with them and that turns them nasty and slimy and poisonous  when his father had finished his breakfast which he did rather in a hurry he got up and went down into the yard to get out his horse and put him to the cab  won't you come and see the cab diamond he said  yes please father if mother can spare me a minute answered diamond  bless the child i don't want him said his mother cheerfully  but as he was following his father out of the door she called him back  diamond just hold the baby one minute i have something to say to your father  so diamond sat down again took the baby in his lap and began poking his face into its little body laughing and singing all the while so that the baby crowed like a little bantam and what he sang was something like this such nonsense to those that couldn't understand it but not to the baby who got all the good in the world out of it   baby's a-sleeping wake up baby for all the swallows are the merriest fellows and have the yellowest children who would go sleeping and snore like a gaby disturbing his mother and father and brother and all a-boring their ears with his snoring snoring snoring for himself and no other for himself in particular wake up baby sit up perpendicular hark to the gushing hark to the rushing where the sheep are the woolliest and the lambs the unruliest and their tails the whitest and their eyes the brightest and baby's the bonniest and baby's the funniest and baby's the shiniest and baby's the tiniest and baby's the merriest and baby's the worriest of all the lambs that plague their dams and mother's the whitest of all the dams that feed the lambs that go crop-cropping without stop-stopping and father's the best of all the swallows that build their nest out of the shining shallows and he has the merriest children that's baby and diamond and diamond and baby and baby and diamond and diamond and baby    here diamond's knees went off in a wild dance which tossed the baby about and shook the laughter out of him in immoderate peals his mother had been listening at the door to the last few lines of his song and came in with the tears in her eyes she took the baby from him gave him a kiss and told him to run to his father  by the time diamond got into the yard the horse was between the shafts and his father was looping the traces on diamond went round to look at the horse the sight of him made him feel very queer he did not know much about different horses and all other horses than their own were very much the same to him but he could not make it out this was diamond and it wasn't diamond diamond didn't hang his head like that yet the head that was hanging was very like the one that diamond used to hold so high diamond's bones didn't show through his skin like that but the skin they pushed out of shape so was very like diamond's skin and the bones might be diamond's bones for he had never seen the shape of them but when he came round in front of the old horse and he put out his long neck and began sniffing at him and rubbing his upper lip and his nose on him then diamond saw it could be no other than old diamond and he did just as his father had done before put his arms round his neck and cried but not much  ain't it jolly father he said was there ever anybody so lucky as me dear old diamond  and he hugged the horse again and kissed both his big hairy cheeks he could only manage one at a time however the other cheek was so far off on the other side of his big head  his father mounted the box with just the same air as diamond thought with which he had used to get upon the coach-box and diamond said to himself father's as grand as ever anyhow he had kept his brown livery-coat only his wife had taken the silver buttons off and put brass ones instead because they did not think it polite to mr coleman in his fallen fortunes to let his crest be seen upon the box of a cab old diamond had kept just his collar and that had the silver crest upon it still for his master thought nobody would notice that and so let it remain for a memorial of the better days of which it reminded him not unpleasantly seeing it had been by no fault either of his or of the old horse's that they had come down in the world together  oh father do let me drive a bit said diamond jumping up on the box beside him  his father changed places with him at once putting the reins into his hands diamond gathered them up eagerly  don't pull at his mouth said his father just feel at it gently to let him know you're there and attending to him that's what i call talking to him through the reins  yes father i understand said diamond then to the horse he said go on diamond and old diamond's ponderous bulk began at once to move to the voice of the little boy  but before they had reached the entrance of the mews another voice called after young diamond which in his turn he had to obey for it was that of his mother diamond diamond it cried and diamond pulled the reins and the horse stood still as a stone  husband said his mother coming up you're never going to trust him with the reins a baby like that  he must learn some day and he can't begin too soon i see already he's a born coachman said his father proudly and i don't see well how he could escape it for my father and my grandfather that's his great-grandfather was all coachmen i'm told so it must come natural to him any one would think besides you see old diamond's as proud of him as we are our own selves wife don't you see how he's turning round his ears with the mouths of them open for the first word he speaks to tumble in he's too well bred to turn his head you know  well but husband i can't do without him to-day everything's got to be done you know it's my first day here and there's that baby  bless you wife i never meant to take him away only to the bottom of endell street he can watch his way back  no thank you father not to-day said diamond mother wants me perhaps she'll let me go another day  very well my man said his father and took the reins which diamond was holding out to him  diamond got down a little disappointed of course and went with his mother who was too pleased to speak she only took hold of his hand as tight as if she had been afraid of his running away instead of glad that he would not leave her  now although they did not know it the owner of the stables the same man who had sold the horse to his father had been standing just inside one of the stable-doors with his hands in his pockets and had heard and seen all that passed and from that day john stonecrop took a great fancy to the little boy and this was the beginning of what came of it  the same evening just as diamond was feeling tired of the day's work and wishing his father would come home mr stonecrop knocked at the door his mother went and opened it  good evening ma'am said he is the little master in  yes to be sure he is at your service i'm sure mr stonecrop said his mother  no no ma'am it's i'm at his service i'm just a-going out with my own cab and if he likes to come with me he shall drive my old horse till he's tired  it's getting rather late for him said his mother thoughtfully you see he's been an invalid  diamond thought what a funny thing how could he have been an invalid when he did not even know what the word meant but of course his mother was right  oh well said mr stonecrop i can just let him drive through bloomsbury square and then he shall run home again  very good sir and i'm much obliged to you said his mother and diamond dancing with delight got his cap put his hand in mr stonecrop's and went with him to the yard where the cab was waiting he did not think the horse looked nearly so nice as diamond nor mr stonecrop nearly so grand as his father but he was none the less pleased he got up on the box and his new friend got up beside him  what's the horse's name whispered diamond as he took the reins from the man  it's not a nice name said mr stonecrop you needn't call him by it i didn't give it him he'll go well enough without it give the boy a whip jack i never carries one when i drive old    he didn't finish the sentence jack handed diamond a whip with which by holding it half down the stick he managed just to flack the haunches of the horse and away he went  mind the gate said mr stonecrop and diamond did mind the gate and guided the nameless horse through it in safety pulling him this way and that according as was necessary diamond learned to drive all the sooner that he had been accustomed to do what he was told and could obey the smallest hint in a moment nothing helps one to get on like that some people don't know how to do what they are told they have not been used to it and they neither understand quickly nor are able to turn what they do understand into action quickly with an obedient mind one learns the rights of things fast enough for it is the law of the universe and to obey is to understand  look out cried mr stonecrop as they were turning the corner into bloomsbury square  it was getting dusky now a cab was approaching rather rapidly from the opposite direction and diamond pulling aside and the other driver pulling up they only just escaped a collision then they knew each other  why diamond it's a bad beginning to run into your own father cried the driver  but father wouldn't it have been a bad ending to run into your own son said diamond in return and the two men laughed heartily  this is very kind of you i'm sure stonecrop said his father  not a bit he's a brave fellow and'll be fit to drive on his own hook in a week or two but i think you'd better let him drive you home now for his mother don't like his having over much of the night air and i promised not to take him farther than the square  come along then diamond said his father as he brought his cab up to the other and moved off the box to the seat beside it diamond jumped across caught at the reins said good-night and thank you mr stonecrop and drove away home feeling more of a man than he had ever yet had a chance of feeling in all his life nor did his father find it necessary to give him a single hint as to his driving only i suspect the fact that it was old diamond and old diamond on his way to his stable may have had something to do with young diamond's success  well child said his mother when he entered the room you've not been long gone  no mother here i am give me the baby  the baby's asleep said his mother  then give him to me and i'll lay him down  but as diamond took him he woke up and began to laugh for he was indeed one of the merriest children and no wonder for he was as plump as a plum-pudding and had never had an ache or a pain that lasted more than five minutes at a time diamond sat down with him and began to sing to him  baby baby babbing your father's gone a-cabbing to catch a shilling for its pence to make the baby babbing dance for old diamond's a duck they say he can swim but the duck of diamonds is baby that's him and of all the swallows the merriest fellows that bake their cake with the water they shake out of the river flowing for ever and make dust into clay on the shiniest day to build their nest father's the best and mother's the whitest and her eyes are the brightest of all the dams that watch their lambs cropping the grass where the waters pass singing for ever and of all the lambs with the shakingest tails and the jumpingest feet baby's the funniest baby's the bonniest and he never wails and he's always sweet and diamond's his nurse and diamond's his nurse and diamond's his nurse   when diamond's rhymes grew scarce he always began dancing the baby some people wondered that such a child could rhyme as he did but his rhymes were not very good for he was only trying to remember what he had heard the river sing at the back of the north wind     chapter xvii diamond goes on   diamond became a great favourite with all the men about the mews some may think it was not the best place in the world for him to be brought up in but it must have been for there he was at first he heard a good many rough and bad words but he did not like them and so they did him little harm he did not know in the least what they meant but there was something in the very sound of them and in the tone of voice in which they were said which diamond felt to be ugly so they did not even stick to him not to say get inside him he never took any notice of them and his face shone pure and good in the middle of them like a primrose in a hailstorm at first because his face was so quiet and sweet with a smile always either awake or asleep in his eyes and because he never heeded their ugly words and rough jokes they said he wasn't all there meaning that he was half an idiot whereas he was a great deal more there than they had the sense to see and before long the bad words found themselves ashamed to come out of the men's mouths when diamond was near the one would nudge the other to remind him that the boy was within hearing and the words choked themselves before they got any farther when they talked to him nicely he had always a good answer sometimes a smart one ready and that helped much to make them change their minds about him  one day jack gave him a curry-comb and a brush to try his hand upon old diamond's coat he used them so deftly so gently and yet so thoroughly as far as he could reach that the man could not help admiring him  you must make haste and grow he said it won't do to have a horse's belly clean and his back dirty you know  give me a leg said diamond and in a moment he was on the old horse's back with the comb and brush he sat on his withers and reaching forward as he ate his hay he curried and he brushed first at one side of his neck and then at the other when that was done he asked for a dressing-comb and combed his mane thoroughly then he pushed himself on to his back and did his shoulders as far down as he could reach then he sat on his croup and did his back and sides then he turned around like a monkey and attacked his hind-quarters and combed his tail this last was not so easy to manage for he had to lift it up and every now and then old diamond would whisk it out of his hands and once he sent the comb flying out of the stable door to the great amusement of the men but jack fetched it again and diamond began once more and did not leave off until he had done the whole business fairly well if not in a first-rate experienced fashion all the time the old horse went on eating his hay and but with an occasional whisk of his tail when diamond tickled or scratched him took no notice of the proceeding but that was all a pretence for he knew very well who it was that was perched on his back and rubbing away at him with the comb and the brush so he was quite pleased and proud and perhaps said to himself something like this   i'm a stupid old horse who can't brush his own coat but there's my young godson on my back cleaning me like an angel  i won't vouch for what the old horse was thinking for it is very difficult to find out what any old horse is thinking  oh dear said diamond when he had done i'm so tired  and he laid himself down at full length on old diamond's back  by this time all the men in the stable were gathered about the two diamonds and all much amused one of them lifted him down and from that time he was a greater favourite than before and if ever there was a boy who had a chance of being a prodigy at cab-driving diamond was that boy for the strife came to be who should have him out with him on the box  his mother however was a little shy of the company for him and besides she could not always spare him also his father liked to have him himself when he could so that he was more desired than enjoyed among the cabmen  but one way and another he did learn to drive all sorts of horses and to drive them well and that through the most crowded streets in london city of course there was the man always on the box-seat beside him but before long there was seldom the least occasion to take the reins from out of his hands for one thing he never got frightened and consequently was never in too great a hurry yet when the moment came for doing something sharp he was always ready for it i must once more remind my readers that he had been to the back of the north wind  one day which was neither washing-day nor cleaning-day nor marketing-day nor saturday nor monday upon which consequently diamond could be spared from the baby his father took him on his own cab after a stray job or two by the way they drew up in the row upon the stand between cockspur street and pall mall they waited a long time but nobody seemed to want to be carried anywhere by and by ladies would be going home from the academy exhibition and then there would be a chance of a job  though to be sure said diamond's father with what truth i cannot say but he believed what he said some ladies is very hard and keeps you to the bare sixpence a mile when every one knows that ain't enough to keep a family and a cab upon to be sure it's the law but mayhap they may get more law than they like some day themselves  as it was very hot diamond's father got down to have a glass of beer himself and give another to the old waterman he left diamond on the box  a sudden noise got up and diamond looked round to see what was the matter  there was a crossing near the cab-stand where a girl was sweeping some rough young imps had picked a quarrel with her and were now hauling at her broom to get it away from her but as they did not pull all together she was holding it against them scolding and entreating alternately  diamond was off his box in a moment and running to the help of the girl he got hold of the broom at her end and pulled along with her but the boys proceeded to rougher measures and one of them hit diamond on the nose and made it bleed and as he could not let go the broom to mind his nose he was soon a dreadful figure but presently his father came back and missing diamond looked about he had to look twice however before he could be sure that that was his boy in the middle of the tumult he rushed in and sent the assailants flying in all directions the girl thanked diamond and began sweeping as if nothing had happened while his father led him away with the help of old tom the waterman he was soon washed into decency and his father set him on the box again perfectly satisfied with the account he gave of the cause of his being in a fray  i couldn't let them behave so to a poor girl could i father he said  certainly not diamond said his father quite pleased for diamond's father was a gentleman  a moment after up came the girl running with her broom over her shoulder and calling cab there cab  diamond's father turned instantly for he was the foremost in the rank and followed the girl one or two other passing cabs heard the cry and made for the place but the girl had taken care not to call till she was near enough to give her friends the first chance when they reached the curbstone who should it be waiting for the cab but mrs and miss coleman they did not look at the cabman however the girl opened the door for them they gave her the address and a penny she told the cabman and away they drove  when they reached the house diamond's father got down and rang the bell as he opened the door of the cab he touched his hat as he had been wont to do the ladies both stared for a moment and then exclaimed together   why joseph can it be you  yes ma'am yes miss answered he again touching his hat with all the respect he could possibly put into the action it's a lucky day which i see you once more upon it  who would have thought it said mrs coleman it's changed times for both of us joseph and it's not very often we can have a cab even but you see my daughter is still very poorly and she can't bear the motion of the omnibuses indeed we meant to walk a bit first before we took a cab but just at the corner for as hot as the sun was a cold wind came down the street and i saw that miss coleman must not face it but to think we should have fallen upon you of all the cabmen in london i didn't know you had got a cab  well you see ma'am i had a chance of buying the old horse and i couldn't resist him there he is looking at you ma'am nobody knows the sense in that head of his  the two ladies went near to pat the horse and then they noticed diamond on the box  why you've got both diamonds with you said miss coleman how do you do diamond  diamond lifted his cap and answered politely  he'll be fit to drive himself before long said his father proudly the old horse is a-teaching of him  well he must come and see us now you've found us out where do you live  diamond's father gave the ladies a ticket with his name and address printed on it and then mrs coleman took out her purse saying   and what's your fare joseph  no thank you ma'am said joseph it was your own old horse as took you and me you paid long ago  he jumped on his box before she could say another word and with a parting salute drove off leaving them on the pavement with the maid holding the door for them  it was a long time now since diamond had seen north wind or even thought much about her and as his father drove along he was thinking not about her but about the crossing-sweeper and was wondering what made him feel as if he knew her quite well when he could not remember anything of her but a picture arose in his mind of a little girl running before the wind and dragging her broom after her and from that by degrees he recalled the whole adventure of the night when he got down from north wind's back in a london street but he could not quite satisfy himself whether the whole affair was not a dream which he had dreamed when he was a very little boy only he had been to the back of the north wind since there could be no doubt of that for when he woke every morning he always knew that he had been there again and as he thought and thought he recalled another thing that had happened that morning which although it seemed a mere accident might have something to do with what had happened since his father had intended going on the stand at king's cross that morning and had turned into gray's inn lane to drive there when they found the way blocked up and upon inquiry were informed that a stack of chimneys had been blown down in the night and had fallen across the road they were just clearing the rubbish away diamond's father turned and made for charing cross  that night the father and mother had a great deal to talk about  poor things said the mother it's worse for them than it is for us you see they've been used to such grand things and for them to come down to a little poky house like that it breaks my heart to think of it  i don't know said diamond thoughtfully whether mrs coleman had bells on her toes  what do you mean child said his mother  she had rings on her fingers anyhow returned diamond  of course she had as any lady would what has that to do with it  when we were down at sandwich said diamond you said you would have to part with your mother's ring now we were poor  bless the child he forgets nothing said his mother really diamond a body would need to mind what they say to you  why said diamond i only think about it  that's just why said the mother  why is that why persisted diamond for he had not yet learned that grown-up people are not often so much grown up that they never talk like children and spoilt ones too  mrs coleman is none so poor as all that yet no thank heaven she's not come to that  is it a great disgrace to be poor asked diamond because of the tone in which his mother had spoken  but his mother whether conscience-stricken i do not know hurried him away to bed where after various attempts to understand her resumed and resumed again in spite of invading sleep he was conquered at last and gave in murmuring over and over to himself why is why but getting no answer to the question     chapter xviii the drunken cabman   a few nights after this diamond woke up suddenly believing he heard north wind thundering along but it was something quite different south wind was moaning round the chimneys to be sure for she was not very happy that night but it was not her voice that had wakened diamond her voice would only have lulled him the deeper asleep it was a loud angry voice now growling like that of a beast now raving like that of a madman and when diamond came a little wider awake he knew that it was the voice of the drunken cabman the wall of whose room was at the head of his bed it was anything but pleasant to hear but he could not help hearing it at length there came a cry from the woman and then a scream from the baby thereupon diamond thought it time that somebody did something and as himself was the only somebody at hand he must go and see whether he could not do something so he got up and put on part of his clothes and went down the stair for the cabman's room did not open upon their stair and he had to go out into the yard and in at the next door this fortunately the cabman being drunk had left open by the time he reached their stair all was still except the voice of the crying baby which guided him to the right door he opened it softly and peeped in there leaning back in a chair with his arms hanging down by his sides and his legs stretched out before him and supported on his heels sat the drunken cabman his wife lay in her clothes upon the bed sobbing and the baby was wailing in the cradle it was very miserable altogether  now the way most people do when they see anything very miserable is to turn away from the sight and try to forget it but diamond began as usual to try to destroy the misery the little boy was just as much one of god's messengers as if he had been an angel with a flaming sword going out to fight the devil the devil he had to fight just then was misery and the way he fought him was the very best like a wise soldier he attacked him first in his weakest point that was the baby for misery can never get such a hold of a baby as of a grown person diamond was knowing in babies and he knew he could do something to make the baby happy for although he had only known one baby as yet and although not one baby is the same as another yet they are so very much alike in some things and he knew that one baby so thoroughly that he had good reason to believe he could do something for any other i have known people who would have begun to fight the devil in a very different and a very stupid way they would have begun by scolding the idiotic cabman and next they would make his wife angry by saying it must be her fault as well as his and by leaving ill-bred though well-meant shabby little books for them to read which they were sure to hate the sight of while all the time they would not have put out a finger to touch the wailing baby but diamond had him out of the cradle in a moment set him up on his knee and told him to look at the light now all the light there was came only from a lamp in the yard and it was a very dingy and yellow light for the glass of the lamp was dirty and the gas was bad but the light that came from it was notwithstanding as certainly light as if it had come from the sun itself and the baby knew that and smiled to it and although it was indeed a wretched room which that lamp lighted so dreary and dirty and empty and hopeless there in the middle of it sat diamond on a stool smiling to the baby and the baby on his knees smiling to the lamp the father of him sat staring at nothing neither asleep nor awake not quite lost in stupidity either for through it all he was dimly angry with himself he did not know why it was that he had struck his wife he had forgotten it but was miserable about it notwithstanding and this misery was the voice of the great love that had made him and his wife and the baby and diamond speaking in his heart and telling him to be good for that great love speaks in the most wretched and dirty hearts only the tone of its voice depends on the echoes of the place in which it sounds on mount sinai it was thunder in the cabman's heart it was misery in the soul of st john it was perfect blessedness  by and by he became aware that there was a voice of singing in the room this of course was the voice of diamond singing to the baby song after song every one as foolish as another to the cabman for he was too tipsy to part one word from another  all the words mixed up in his ear in a gurgle without division or stop for such was the way he spoke himself when he was in this horrid condition but the baby was more than content with diamond's songs and diamond himself was so contented with what the songs were all about that he did not care a bit about the songs themselves if only baby liked them but they did the cabman good as well as the baby and diamond for they put him to sleep and the sleep was busy all the time it lasted smoothing the wrinkles out of his temper  at length diamond grew tired of singing and began to talk to the baby instead and as soon as he stopped singing the cabman began to wake up his brain was a little clearer now his temper a little smoother and his heart not quite so dirty he began to listen and he went on listening and heard diamond saying to the baby something like this for he thought the cabman was asleep   poor daddy baby's daddy takes too much beer and gin and that makes him somebody else and not his own self at all baby's daddy would never hit baby's mammy if he didn't take too much beer he's very fond of baby's mammy and works from morning to night to get her breakfast and dinner and supper only at night he forgets and pays the money away for beer and they put nasty stuff in beer i've heard my daddy say that drives all the good out and lets all the bad in daddy says when a man takes a drink there's a thirsty devil creeps into his inside because he knows he will always get enough there and the devil is always crying out for more drink and that makes the man thirsty and so he drinks more and more till he kills himself with it and then the ugly devil creeps out of him and crawls about on his belly looking for some other cabman to get into that he may drink drink drink that's what my daddy says baby and he says too the only way to make the devil come out is to give him plenty of cold water and tea and coffee and nothing at all that comes from the public-house for the devil can't abide that kind of stuff and creeps out pretty soon for fear of being drowned in it but your daddy will drink the nasty stuff poor man i wish he wouldn't for it makes mammy cross with him and no wonder and then when mammy's cross he's crosser and there's nobody in the house to take care of them but baby and you do take care of them baby don't you baby i know you do babies always take care of their fathers and mothers don't they baby that's what they come for isn't it baby and when daddy stops drinking beer and nasty gin with turpentine in it father says then mammy will be so happy and look so pretty and daddy will be so good to baby and baby will be as happy as a swallow which is the merriest fellow and diamond will be so happy too and when diamond's a man he'll take baby out with him on the box and teach him to drive a cab  he went on with chatter like this till baby was asleep by which time he was tired and father and mother were both wide awake only rather confused the one from the beer the other from the blow and staring the one from his chair the other from her bed at diamond but he was quite unaware of their notice for he sat half-asleep with his eyes wide open staring in his turn though without knowing it at the cabman while the cabman could not withdraw his gaze from diamond's white face and big eyes for diamond's face was always rather pale and now it was paler than usual with sleeplessness and the light of the street-lamp upon it at length he found himself nodding and he knew then it was time to put the baby down lest he should let him fall so he rose from the little three-legged stool and laid the baby in the cradle and covered him up it was well it was a warm night and he did not want much covering and then he all but staggered out of the door he was so tipsy himself with sleep  wife said the cabman turning towards the bed i do somehow believe that wur a angel just gone did you see him wife he warn't wery big and he hadn't got none o' them wingses you know it wur one o' them baby-angels you sees on the gravestones you know  nonsense hubby said his wife but it's just as good i might say better for you can ketch hold of him when you like that's little diamond as everybody knows and a duck o' diamonds he is no woman could wish for a better child than he be  i ha' heerd on him in the stable but i never see the brat afore come old girl let bygones be bygones and gie us a kiss and we'll go to bed  the cabman kept his cab in another yard although he had his room in this he was often late in coming home and was not one to take notice of children especially when he was tipsy which was oftener than not hence if he had ever seen diamond he did not know him but his wife knew him well enough as did every one else who lived all day in the yard she was a good-natured woman it was she who had got the fire lighted and the tea ready for them when diamond and his mother came home from sandwich and her husband was not an ill-natured man either and when in the morning he recalled not only diamond's visit but how he himself had behaved to his wife he was very vexed with himself and gladdened his poor wife's heart by telling her how sorry he was and for a whole week after he did not go near the public-house hard as it was to avoid it seeing a certain rich brewer had built one like a trap to catch souls and bodies in at almost every corner he had to pass on his way home indeed he was never quite so bad after that though it was some time before he began really to reform     chapter xix diamond's friends   one day when old diamond was standing with his nose in his bag between pall mall and cockspur street and his master was reading the newspaper on the box of his cab which was the last of a good many in the row little diamond got down for a run for his legs were getting cramped with sitting and first of all he strolled with his hands in his pockets up to the crossing where the girl and her broom were to be found in all weathers just as he was going to speak to her a tall gentleman stepped upon the crossing he was pleased to find it so clean for the streets were muddy and he had nice boots on so he put his hand in his pocket and gave the girl a penny but when she gave him a sweet smile in return and made him a pretty courtesy he looked at her again and said   where do you live my child  paradise row she answered next door to the adam and eve down the area  whom do you live with he asked  my wicked old grannie she replied  you shouldn't call your grannie wicked said the gentleman  but she is said the girl looking up confidently in his face if you don't believe me you can come and take a look at her  the words sounded rude but the girl's face looked so simple that the gentleman saw she did not mean to be rude and became still more interested in her  still you shouldn't say so he insisted  shouldn't i everybody calls her wicked old grannie even them that's as wicked as her you should hear her swear there's nothing like it in the row indeed i assure you sir there's ne'er a one of them can shut my grannie up once she begins and gets right a-going you must put her in a passion first you know it's no good till you do that she's so old now how she do make them laugh to be sure  although she called her wicked the child spoke so as plainly to indicate pride in her grannie's pre-eminence in swearing  the gentleman looked very grave to hear her for he was sorry that such a nice little girl should be in such bad keeping but he did not know what to say next and stood for a moment with his eyes on the ground when he lifted them he saw the face of diamond looking up in his  please sir said diamond her grannie's very cruel to her sometimes and shuts her out in the streets at night if she happens to be late  is this your brother asked the gentleman of the girl  no sir  how does he know your grandmother then he does not look like one of her sort  oh no sir he's a good boy quite  here she tapped her forehead with her finger in a significant manner  what do you mean by that asked the gentleman while diamond looked on smiling  the cabbies call him god's baby she whispered he's not right in the head you know a tile loose  still diamond though he heard every word and understood it too kept on smiling what could it matter what people called him so long as he did nothing he ought not to do and besides god's baby was surely the best of names  well my little man and what can you do asked the gentleman turning towards him just for the sake of saying something  drive a cab said diamond  good and what else he continued for accepting what the girl had said he regarded the still sweetness of diamond's face as a sign of silliness and wished to be kind to the poor little fellow  nurse a baby said diamond  well and what else  clean father's boots and make him a bit of toast for his tea  you're a useful little man said the gentleman what else can you do  not much that i know of said diamond i can't curry a horse except somebody puts me on his back so i don't count that  can you read  no but mother can and father can and they're going to teach me some day soon  well here's a penny for you  thank you sir  and when you have learned to read come to me and i'll give you sixpence and a book with fine pictures in it  please sir where am i to come asked diamond who was too much a man of the world not to know that he must have the gentleman's address before he could go and see him  you're no such silly thought he as he put his hand in his pocket and brought out a card there he said your father will be able to read that and tell you where to go  yes sir thank you sir said diamond and put the card in his pocket  the gentleman walked away but turning round a few paces off saw diamond give his penny to the girl and walking slower heard him say   i've got a father and mother and little brother and you've got nothing but a wicked old grannie you may have my penny  the girl put it beside the other in her pocket the only trustworthy article of dress she wore her grandmother always took care that she had a stout pocket  is she as cruel as ever asked diamond  much the same but i gets more coppers now than i used to and i can get summats to eat and take browns enough home besides to keep her from grumbling it's a good thing she's so blind though  why asked diamond  'cause if she was as sharp in the eyes as she used to be she would find out i never eats her broken wittles and then she'd know as i must get something somewheres  doesn't she watch you then  o' course she do don't she just but i make believe and drop it in my lap and then hitch it into my pocket  what would she do if she found you out  she never give me no more  but you don't want it  yes i do want it  what do you do with it then  give it to cripple jim  who's cripple jim  a boy in the row his mother broke his leg when he wur a kid so he's never come to much but he's a good boy is jim and i love jim dearly i always keeps off a penny for jim leastways as often as i can but there i must sweep again for them busses makes no end o' dirt  diamond diamond cried his father who was afraid he might get no good by talking to the girl and diamond obeyed and got up again upon the box he told his father about the gentleman and what he had promised him if he would learn to read and showed him the gentleman's card  why it's not many doors from the mews said his father giving him back the card take care of it my boy for it may lead to something god knows in these hard times a man wants as many friends as he's ever likely to get  haven't you got friends enough father asked diamond  well i have no right to complain but the more the better you know  just let me count said diamond  and he took his hands from his pockets and spreading out the fingers of his left hand began to count beginning at the thumb  there's mother first and then baby and then me next there's old diamond and the cab no i won't count the cab for it never looks at you and when diamond's out of the shafts it's nobody then there's the man that drinks next door and his wife and his baby  they're no friends of mine said his father  well they're friends of mine said diamond  his father laughed  much good they'll do you he said  how do you know they won't returned diamond  well go on said his father  then there's jack and mr stonecrop and deary me not to have mentioned mr coleman and mrs coleman and miss coleman and mrs crump and then there's the clergyman that spoke to me in the garden that day the tree was blown down  what's his name  i don't know his name  where does he live  i don't know  how can you count him then  he did talk to me and very kindlike too  his father laughed again  why child you're just counting everybody you know that don't make 'em friends  don't it i thought it did well but they shall be my friends i shall make 'em  how will you do that  they can't help themselves then if they would if i choose to be their friend you know they can't prevent me then there's that girl at the crossing  a fine set of friends you do have to be sure diamond  surely she's a friend anyhow father if it hadn't been for her you would never have got mrs coleman and miss coleman to carry home  his father was silent for he saw that diamond was right and was ashamed to find himself more ungrateful than he had thought  then there's the new gentleman diamond went on  if he do as he say interposed his father  and why shouldn't he i daresay sixpence ain't too much for him to spare but i don't quite understand father  is nobody your friend but the one that does something for you  no i won't say that my boy you would have to leave out baby then  oh no i shouldn't baby can laugh in your face and crow in your ears and make you feel so happy call you that nothing father  the father's heart was fairly touched now he made no answer to this last appeal and diamond ended off with saying   and there's the best of mine to come yet and that's you daddy except it be mother you know you're my friend daddy ain't you and i'm your friend ain't i  and god for us all said his father and then they were both silent for that was very solemn     chapter xx diamond learns to read   the question of the tall gentleman as to whether diamond could read or not set his father thinking it was high time he could and as soon as old diamond was suppered and bedded he began the task that very night but it was not much of a task to diamond for his father took for his lesson-book those very rhymes his mother had picked up on the sea-shore and as diamond was not beginning too soon he learned very fast indeed within a month he was able to spell out most of the verses for himself  but he had never come upon the poem he thought he had heard his mother read from it that day he had looked through and through the book several times after he knew the letters and a few words fancying he could tell the look of it but had always failed to find one more like it than another so he wisely gave up the search till he could really read then he resolved to begin at the beginning and read them all straight through this took him nearly a fortnight when he had almost reached the end he came upon the following verses which took his fancy much although they were certainly not very like those he was in search of   little boy blue              little boy blue lost his way in a wood                sing apples and cherries roses and honey             he said i would not go back if i could                it's all so jolly and funny              he sang this wood is all my own                apples and cherries roses and honey             so here i'll sit like a king on my throne                all so jolly and funny              a little snake crept out of the tree                apples and cherries roses and honey             lie down at my feet little snake said he                all so jolly and funny              a little bird sang in the tree overhead                apples and cherries roses and honey             come and sing your song on my finger instead                all so jolly and funny              the snake coiled up and the bird flew down             and sang him the song of birdie brown              little boy blue found it tiresome to sit             and he thought he had better walk on a bit              so up he got his way to take             and he said come along little bird and snake              and waves of snake o'er the damp leaves passed             and the snake went first and birdie brown last              by boy blue's head with flutter and dart             flew birdie brown with its song in its heart              he came where the apples grew red and sweet              tree drop me an apple down at my feet              he came where the cherries hung plump and red              come to my mouth sweet kisses he said              and the boughs bow down and the apples they dapple             the grass too many for him to grapple              and the cheeriest cherries with never a miss             fall to his mouth each a full-grown kiss              he met a little brook singing a song             he said little brook you are going wrong              you must follow me follow me follow i say             do as i tell you and come this way              and the song-singing sing-songing forest brook             leaped from its bed and after him took              followed him followed  and pale and wan             the dead leaves rustled as the water ran              and every bird high up on the bough             and every creature low down below              he called and the creatures obeyed the call             took their legs and their wings and followed him all              squirrels that carried their tails like a sack             each on his own little humpy brown back              householder snails and slugs all tails             and butterflies flutterbies ships all sails              and weasels and ousels and mice and larks             and owls and rere-mice and harkydarks              all went running and creeping and flowing             after the merry boy fluttering and going              the dappled fawns fawning the fallow-deer following             the swallows and flies flying and swallowing              cockchafers henchafers cockioli-birds             cockroaches henroaches cuckoos in herds              the spider forgot and followed him spinning             and lost all his thread from end to beginning              the gay wasp forgot his rings and his waist             he never had made such undignified haste              the dragon-flies melted to mist with their hurrying             the mole in his moleskins left his barrowing burrowing              the bees went buzzing so busy and beesy             and the midges in columns so upright and easy              but little boy blue was not content             calling for followers still as he went              blowing his horn and beating his drum             and crying aloud come all of you come              he said to the shadows come after me              and the shadows began to flicker and flee              and they flew through the wood all flattering and fluttering             over the dead leaves flickering and muttering              and he said to the wind come follow come follow             with whistle and pipe and rustle and hollo              and the wind wound round at his desire             as if he had been the gold cock on the spire              and the cock itself flew down from the church             and left the farmers all in the lurch              they run and they fly they creep and they come             everything everything all and some              the very trees they tugged at their roots             only their feet were too fast in their boots              after him leaning and straining and bending             as on through their boles he kept walking and wending              till out of the wood he burst on a lea             shouting and calling come after me              and then they rose up with a leafy hiss             and stood as if nothing had been amiss              little boy blue sat down on a stone             and the creatures came round him every one              and he said to the clouds i want you there              and down they sank through the thin blue air              and he said to the sunset far in the west             come here i want you i know best              and the sunset came and stood up on the wold             and burned and glowed in purple and gold              then little boy blue began to ponder              what's to be done with them all i wonder              then little boy blue he said quite low             what to do with you all i am sure i don't know              then the clouds clodded down till dismal it grew             the snake sneaked close round birdie brown flew              the brook sat up like a snake on its tail             and the wind came up with a what-will-you wail              and all the creatures sat and stared             the mole opened his very eyes and glared              and for rats and bats and the world and his wife             little boy blue was afraid of his life              then birdie brown began to sing             and what he sang was the very thing               you have brought us all hither little boy blue             pray what do you want us all to do              go away  go away said little boy blue             i'm sure i don't want you get away do              no no no no no yes and no no              sang birdie brown it mustn't be so              we cannot for nothing come here and away             give us some work or else we stay              oh dear and oh dear with sob and with sigh             said little boy blue and began to cry              but before he got far he thought of a thing             and up he stood and spoke like a king              why do you hustle and jostle and bother             off with you all  take me back to my mother              the sunset stood at the gates of the west             follow me follow me came from birdie brown's breast              i am going that way as fast as i can              said the brook as it sank and turned and ran              back to the woods fled the shadows like ghosts              if we stay we shall all be missed from our posts              said the wind with a voice that had changed its cheer             i was just going there when you brought me here              that's where i live said the sack-backed squirrel             and he turned his sack with a swing and a swirl              said the cock of the spire his father's churchwarden              said the brook running faster i run through his garden              said the mole two hundred worms there i caught 'em             last year and i'm going again next autumn              said they all if that's where you want us to steer for             what in earth or in water did you bring us here for              never you mind said little boy blue             that's what i tell you  if that you won't do              i'll get up at once and go home without you             i think i will i begin to doubt you              he rose and up rose the snake on its tail             and hissed three times half a hiss half a wail              little boy blue he tried to go past him             but wherever he turned sat the snake and faced him              if you don't get out of my way he said             i tell you snake i will break your head              the snake he neither would go nor come             so he hit him hard with the stick of his drum              the snake fell down as if he were dead             and little boy blue set his foot on his head              and all the creatures they marched before him             and marshalled him home with a high cockolorum              and birdie brown sang twirrrr twitter twirrrr twee              apples and cherries roses and honey             little boy blue has listened to me              all so jolly and funny     chapter xxi sal's nanny   diamond managed with many blunders to read this rhyme to his mother  isn't it nice mother he said  yes it's pretty she answered  i think it means something returned diamond  i'm sure i don't know what she said  i wonder if it's the same boy yes it must be the same little boy blue you know let me see how does that rhyme go  little boy blue come blow me your horn   yes of course it is for this one went `blowing his horn and beating his drum' he had a drum too              little boy blue come blow me your horn             the sheep's in the meadow the cow's in the corn  he had to keep them out you know but he wasn't minding his work it goes               where's the little boy that looks after the sheep             he's under the haystack fast asleep  there you see mother and then let me see               who'll go and wake him  no not i             for if i do he'll be sure to cry  so i suppose nobody did wake him he was a rather cross little boy i daresay when woke up and when he did wake of himself and saw the mischief the cow had done to the corn instead of running home to his mother he ran away into the wood and lost himself don't you think that's very likely mother  i shouldn't wonder she answered  so you see he was naughty for even when he lost himself he did not want to go home any of the creatures would have shown him the way if he had asked it all but the snake he followed the snake you know and he took him farther away i suppose it was a young one of the same serpent that tempted adam and eve father was telling us about it last sunday you remember  bless the child said his mother to herself and then added aloud finding that diamond did not go on well what next  i don't know mother i'm sure there's a great deal more but what it is i can't say i only know that he killed the snake i suppose that's what he had a drumstick for he couldn't do it with his horn  but surely you're not such a silly as to take it all for true diamond  i think it must be it looks true that killing of the snake looks true it's what i've got to do so often  his mother looked uneasy diamond smiled full in her face and added   when baby cries and won't be happy and when father and you talk about your troubles i mean  this did little to reassure his mother and lest my reader should have his qualms about it too i venture to remind him once more that diamond had been to the back of the north wind  finding she made no reply diamond went on   in a week or so i shall be able to go to the tall gentleman and tell him i can read and i'll ask him if he can help me to understand the rhyme  but before the week was out he had another reason for going to mr raymond  for three days on each of which at one time or other diamond's father was on the same stand near the national gallery the girl was not at her crossing and diamond got quite anxious about her fearing she must be ill on the fourth day not seeing her yet he said to his father who had that moment shut the door of his cab upon a fare   father i want to go and look after the girl she can't be well  all right said his father only take care of yourself diamond  so saying he climbed on his box and drove off  he had great confidence in his boy you see and would trust him anywhere but if he had known the kind of place in which the girl lived he would perhaps have thought twice before he allowed him to go alone diamond who did know something of it had not however any fear from talking to the girl he had a good notion of where about it was and he remembered the address well enough so by asking his way some twenty times mostly of policemen he came at length pretty near the place the last policeman he questioned looked down upon him from the summit of six feet two inches and replied with another question but kindly   what do you want there my small kid it ain't where you was bred i guess  no sir answered diamond i live in bloomsbury  that's a long way off said the policeman  yes it's a good distance answered diamond but i find my way about pretty well policemen are always kind to me  but what on earth do you want here  diamond told him plainly what he was about and of course the man believed him for nobody ever disbelieved diamond people might think he was mistaken but they never thought he was telling a story  it's an ugly place said the policeman  is it far off asked diamond  no it's next door almost but it's not safe  nobody hurts me said diamond  i must go with you i suppose  oh no please not said diamond they might think i was going to meddle with them and i ain't you know  well do as you please said the man and gave him full directions  diamond set off never suspecting that the policeman who was a kind-hearted man with children of his own was following him close and watching him round every corner as he went on all at once he thought he remembered the place and whether it really was so or only that he had laid up the policeman's instructions well in his mind he went straight for the cellar of old sal  he's a sharp little kid anyhow for as simple as he looks said the man to himself not a wrong turn does he take but old sal's a rum un for such a child to pay a morning visit to she's worse when she's sober than when she's half drunk i've seen her when she'd have torn him in pieces  happily then for diamond old sal had gone out to get some gin when he came to her door at the bottom of the area-stair and knocked he received no answer he laid his ear to the door and thought he heard a moaning within so he tried the door and found it was not locked it was a dreary place indeed and very dark for the window was below the level of the street and covered with mud while over the grating which kept people from falling into the area stood a chest of drawers placed there by a dealer in second-hand furniture which shut out almost all the light and the smell in the place was dreadful diamond stood still for a while for he could see next to nothing but he heard the moaning plainly enough now when he got used to the darkness he discovered his friend lying with closed eyes and a white suffering face on a heap of little better than rags in a corner of the den he went up to her and spoke but she made him no answer indeed she was not in the least aware of his presence and diamond saw that he could do nothing for her without help so taking a lump of barley-sugar from his pocket which he had bought for her as he came along and laying it beside her he left the place having already made up his mind to go and see the tall gentleman mr raymond and ask him to do something for sal's nanny as the girl was called  by the time he got up the area-steps three or four women who had seen him go down were standing together at the top waiting for him they wanted his clothes for their children but they did not follow him down lest sal should find them there the moment he appeared they laid their hands on him and all began talking at once for each wanted to get some advantage over her neighbours he told them quite quietly for he was not frightened that he had come to see what was the matter with nanny  what do you know about nanny said one of them fiercely wait till old sal comes home and you'll catch it for going prying into her house when she's out if you don't give me your jacket directly i'll go and fetch her  i can't give you my jacket said diamond it belongs to my father and mother you know it's not mine to give is it now you would not think it right to give away what wasn't yours would you now  give it away no that i wouldn't i'd keep it she said with a rough laugh but if the jacket ain't yours what right have you to keep it here cherry make haste it'll be one go apiece  they all began to tug at the jacket while diamond stooped and kept his arms bent to resist them before they had done him or the jacket any harm however suddenly they all scampered away and diamond looking in the opposite direction saw the tall policeman coming towards him  you had better have let me come with you little man he said looking down in diamond's face which was flushed with his resistance  you came just in the right time thank you returned diamond they've done me no harm  they would have if i hadn't been at hand though  yes but you were at hand you know so they couldn't  perhaps the answer was deeper in purport than either diamond or the policeman knew they walked away together diamond telling his new friend how ill poor nanny was and that he was going to let the tall gentleman know the policeman put him in the nearest way for bloomsbury and stepping out in good earnest diamond reached mr raymond's door in less than an hour when he asked if he was at home the servant in return asked what he wanted  i want to tell him something  but i can't go and trouble him with such a message as that  he told me to come to him that is when i could read and i can  how am i to know that  diamond stared with astonishment for one moment then answered   why i've just told you that's how you know it  but this man was made of coarser grain than the policeman and instead of seeing that diamond could not tell a lie he put his answer down as impudence and saying do you think i'm going to take your word for it shut the door in his face  diamond turned and sat down on the doorstep thinking with himself that the tall gentleman must either come in or come out and he was therefore in the best possible position for finding him he had not waited long before the door opened again but when he looked round it was only the servant once more  get away he said what are you doing on the doorstep  waiting for mr raymond answered diamond getting up  he's not at home  then i'll wait till he comes returned diamond sitting down again with a smile  what the man would have done next i do not know but a step sounded from the hall and when diamond looked round yet again there was the tall gentleman  who's this john he asked  i don't know sir an imperent little boy as will sit on the doorstep  please sir said diamond he told me you weren't at home and i sat down to wait for you  eh what said mr raymond john john this won't do is it a habit of yours to turn away my visitors there'll be some one else to turn away i'm afraid if i find any more of this kind of thing come in my little man i suppose you've come to claim your sixpence  no sir not that  what can't you read yet  yes i can now a little but i'll come for that next time i came to tell you about sal's nanny  who's sal's nanny  the girl at the crossing you talked to the same day  oh yes i remember what's the matter has she got run over  then diamond told him all  now mr raymond was one of the kindest men in london he sent at once to have the horse put to the brougham took diamond with him and drove to the children's hospital there he was well known to everybody for he was not only a large subscriber but he used to go and tell the children stories of an afternoon one of the doctors promised to go and find nanny and do what could be done have her brought to the hospital if possible  that same night they sent a litter for her and as she could be of no use to old sal until she was better she did not object to having her removed so she was soon lying in the fever ward for the first time in her life in a nice clean bed but she knew nothing of the whole affair she was too ill to know anything     chapter xxii mr raymond's riddle   mr raymond took diamond home with him stopping at the mews to tell his mother that he would send him back soon diamond ran in with the message himself and when he reappeared he had in his hand the torn and crumpled book which north wind had given him  ah i see said mr raymond  you are going to claim your sixpence now  i wasn't thinking of that so much as of another thing said diamond there's a rhyme in this book i can't quite understand i want you to tell me what it means if you please  i will if i can answered mr raymond you shall read it to me when we get home and then i shall see  still with a good many blunders diamond did read it after a fashion mr raymond took the little book and read it over again  now mr raymond was a poet himself and so although he had never been at the back of the north wind he was able to understand the poem pretty well but before saying anything about it he read it over aloud and diamond thought he understood it much better already  i'll tell you what i think it means he then said it means that people may have their way for a while if they like but it will get them into such troubles they'll wish they hadn't had it  i know i know said diamond like the poor cabman next door he drinks too much  just so returned mr raymond but when people want to do right things about them will try to help them only they must kill the snake you know  i was sure the snake had something to do with it cried diamond triumphantly  a good deal more talk followed and mr raymond gave diamond his sixpence  what will you do with it he asked  take it home to my mother he answered she has a teapot such a black one with a broken spout and she keeps all her money in it it ain't much but she saves it up to buy shoes for me and there's baby coming on famously and he'll want shoes soon and every sixpence is something ain't it sir  to be sure my man i hope you'll always make as good a use of your money  i hope so sir said diamond  and here's a book for you full of pictures and stories and poems i wrote it myself chiefly for the children of the hospital where i hope nanny is going i don't mean i printed it you know i made it added mr raymond wishing diamond to understand that he was the author of the book  i know what you mean i make songs myself they're awfully silly but they please baby and that's all they're meant for  couldn't you let me hear one of them now said mr raymond  no sir i couldn't i forget them as soon as i've done with them besides i couldn't make a line without baby on my knee we make them together you know they're just as much baby's as mine it's he that pulls them out of me  i suspect the child's a genius said the poet to himself and that's what makes people think him silly  now if any of my child readers want to know what a genius is shall i try to tell them or shall i not i will give them one very short answer  it means one who understands things without any other body telling him what they mean god makes a few such now and then to teach the rest of us  do you like riddles asked mr raymond turning over the leaves of his own book  i don't know what a riddle is said diamond  it's something that means something else and you've got to find out what the something else is  mr raymond liked the old-fashioned riddle best and had written a few one of which he now read              i have only one foot but thousands of toes             my one foot stands but never goes             i have many arms and they're mighty all             and hundreds of fingers large and small             from the ends of my fingers my beauty grows             i breathe with my hair and i drink with my toes             i grow bigger and bigger about the waist             and yet i am always very tight laced             none e'er saw me eat i've no mouth to bite             yet i eat all day in the full sunlight             in the summer with song i shave and quiver             but in winter i fast and groan and shiver   do you know what that means diamond he asked when he had finished  no indeed i don't answered diamond  then you can read it for yourself and think over it and see if you can find out said mr raymond giving him the book and now you had better go home to your mother when you've found the riddle you can come again  if diamond had had to find out the riddle in order to see mr raymond again i doubt if he would ever have seen him  oh then i think i hear some little reader say he could not have been a genius for a genius finds out things without being told  i answer genius finds out truths not tricks and if you do not understand that i am afraid you must be content to wait till you grow older and know more     chapter xxiii the early bird   when diamond got home he found his father at home already sitting by the fire and looking rather miserable for his head ached and he felt sick he had been doing night work of late and it had not agreed with him so he had given it up but not in time for he had taken some kind of fever the next day he was forced to keep his bed and his wife nursed him and diamond attended to the baby if he had not been ill it would have been delightful to have him at home and the first day diamond sang more songs than ever to the baby and his father listened with some pleasure but the next he could not bear even diamond's sweet voice and was very ill indeed so diamond took the baby into his own room and had no end of quiet games with him there if he did pull all his bedding on the floor it did not matter for he kept baby very quiet and made the bed himself again and slept in it with baby all the next night and many nights after  but long before his father got well his mother's savings were all but gone she did not say a word about it in the hearing of her husband lest she should distress him and one night when she could not help crying she came into diamond's room that his father might not hear her she thought diamond was asleep but he was not when he heard her sobbing he was frightened and said   is father worse mother  no diamond she answered as well as she could he's a good bit better  then what are you crying for mother  because my money is almost all gone she replied  o mammy you make me think of a little poem baby and i learned out of north wind's book to-day don't you remember how i bothered you about some of the words  yes child said his mother heedlessly thinking only of what she should do after to-morrow  diamond began and repeated the poem for he had a wonderful memory              a little bird sat on the edge of her nest                her yellow-beaks slept as sound as tops             that day she had done her very best                and had filled every one of their little crops             she had filled her own just over-full                and hence she was feeling a little dull              oh dear she sighed as she sat with her head                sunk in her chest and no neck at all             while her crop stuck out like a feather bed                turned inside out and rather small             what shall i do if things don't reform             i don't know where there's a single worm              i've had twenty to-day and the children five each                besides a few flies and some very fat spiders              no one will say i don't do as i preach                 i'm one of the best of bird-providers             but where's the use  we want a storm                 i don't know where there's a single worm              there's five in my crop said a wee wee bird                which woke at the voice of his mother's pain             i know where there's five and with the word                he tucked in his head and went off again             the folly of childhood sighed his mother             has always been my especial bother              the yellow-beaks they slept on and on                 they never had heard of the bogy to-morrow             but the mother sat outside making her moan                 she'll soon have to beg or steal or borrow             for she never can tell the night before             where she shall find one red worm more              the fact as i say was she'd had too many                she couldn't sleep and she called it virtue             motherly foresight affection any                name you may call it that will not hurt you             so it was late ere she tucked her head in             and she slept so late it was almost a sin              but the little fellow who knew of five                nor troubled his head about any more             woke very early felt quite alive                and wanted a sixth to add to his store              he pushed his mother the greedy elf             then thought he had better try for himself              when his mother awoke and had rubbed her eyes                feeling less like a bird and more like a mole             she saw him fancy with what surprise                 dragging a huge worm out of a hole             'twas of this same hero the proverb took form              'tis the early bird that catches the worm   there mother said diamond as he finished ain't it funny  i wish you were like that little bird diamond and could catch worms for yourself said his mother as she rose to go and look after her husband  diamond lay awake for a few minutes thinking what he could do to catch worms it was very little trouble to make up his mind however and still less to go to sleep after it     chapter xxiv another early bird   he got up in the morning as soon as he heard the men moving in the yard he tucked in his little brother so that he could not tumble out of bed and then went out leaving the door open so that if he should cry his mother might hear him at once when he got into the yard he found the stable-door just opened  i'm the early bird i think he said to himself i hope i shall catch the worm  he would not ask any one to help him fearing his project might meet with disapproval and opposition with great difficulty but with the help of a broken chair he brought down from his bedroom he managed to put the harness on diamond if the old horse had had the least objection to the proceeding of course he could not have done it but even when it came to the bridle he opened his mouth for the bit just as if he had been taking the apple which diamond sometimes gave him he fastened the cheek-strap very carefully just in the usual hole for fear of choking his friend or else letting the bit get amongst his teeth it was a job to get the saddle on but with the chair he managed it if old diamond had had an education in physics to equal that of the camel he would have knelt down to let him put it on his back but that was more than could be expected of him and then diamond had to creep quite under him to get hold of the girth the collar was almost the worst part of the business but there diamond could help diamond he held his head very low till his little master had got it over and turned it round and then he lifted his head and shook it on to his shoulders the yoke was rather difficult but when he had laid the traces over the horse's neck the weight was not too much for him he got him right at last and led him out of the stable  by this time there were several of the men watching him but they would not interfere they were so anxious to see how he would get over the various difficulties they followed him as far as the stable-door and there stood watching him again as he put the horse between the shafts got them up one after the other into the loops fastened the traces the belly-band the breeching and the reins  then he got his whip the moment he mounted the box the men broke into a hearty cheer of delight at his success but they would not let him go without a general inspection of the harness and although they found it right for not a buckle had to be shifted they never allowed him to do it for himself again all the time his father was ill  the cheer brought his mother to the window and there she saw her little boy setting out alone with the cab in the gray of morning she tugged at the window but it was stiff and before she could open it diamond who was in a great hurry was out of the mews and almost out of the street she called diamond diamond but there was no answer except from jack  never fear for him ma'am said jack it 'ud be only a devil as would hurt him and there ain't so many o' them as some folk 'ud have you believe a boy o' diamond's size as can 'arness a 'oss t'other diamond's size and put him to right as a trivet if he do upset the keb 'll fall on his feet ma'am  but he won't upset the cab will he jack  not he ma'am leastways he won't go for to do it  i know as much as that myself what do you mean  i mean he's a little likely to do it as the oldest man in the stable how's the gov'nor to-day ma'am  a good deal better thank you she answered closing the window in some fear lest her husband should have been made anxious by the news of diamond's expedition he knew pretty well however what his boy was capable of and although not quite easy was less anxious than his mother but as the evening drew on the anxiety of both of them increased and every sound of wheels made his father raise himself in his bed and his mother peep out of the window  diamond had resolved to go straight to the cab-stand where he was best known and never to crawl for fear of getting annoyed by idlers before he got across oxford street however he was hailed by a man who wanted to catch a train and was in too great a hurry to think about the driver having carried him to king's cross in good time and got a good fare in return he set off again in great spirits and reached the stand in safety he was the first there after all  as the men arrived they all greeted him kindly and inquired after his father  ain't you afraid of the old 'oss running away with you asked one  no he wouldn't run away with me answered diamond he knows i'm getting the shillings for father or if he did he would only run home  well you're a plucky one for all your girl's looks said the man and i wish ye luck  thank you sir said diamond i'll do what i can i came to the old place you see because i knew you would let me have my turn here  in the course of the day one man did try to cut him out but he was a stranger and the shout the rest of them raised let him see it would not do and made him so far ashamed besides that he went away crawling  once in a block a policeman came up to him and asked him for his number diamond showed him his father's badge saying with a smile   father's ill at home and so i came out with the cab there's no fear of me i can drive besides the old horse could go alone  just as well i daresay you're a pair of 'em but you are a rum 'un for a cabby ain't you now said the policeman i don't know as i ought to let you go  i ain't done nothing said diamond it's not my fault i'm no bigger i'm big enough for my age  that's where it is said the man you ain't fit  how do you know that asked diamond with his usual smile and turning his head like a little bird  why how are you to get out of this ruck now when it begins to move  just you get up on the box said diamond and i'll show you there that van's a-moving now jump up  the policeman did as diamond told him and was soon satisfied that the little fellow could drive  well he said as he got down again i don't know as i should be right to interfere good luck to you my little man  thank you sir said diamond and drove away  in a few minutes a gentleman hailed him  are you the driver of this cab he asked  yes sir said diamond showing his badge of which he was proud  you're the youngest cabman i ever saw how am i to know you won't break all my bones  i would rather break all my own said diamond but if you're afraid never mind me i shall soon get another fare  i'll risk it said the gentleman and opening the door himself he jumped in  he was going a good distance and soon found that diamond got him over the ground well now when diamond had only to go straight ahead and had not to mind so much what he was about his thoughts always turned to the riddle mr raymond had set him and this gentleman looked so clever that he fancied he must be able to read it for him he had given up all hope of finding it out for himself and he could not plague his father about it when he was ill he had thought of the answer himself but fancied it could not be the right one for to see how it all fitted required some knowledge of physiology so when he reached the end of his journey he got down very quickly and with his head just looking in at the window said as the gentleman gathered his gloves and newspapers   please sir can you tell me the meaning of a riddle  you must tell me the riddle first answered the gentleman amused  diamond repeated the riddle  oh that's easy enough he returned it's a tree  well it ain't got no mouth sure enough but how then does it eat all day long  it sucks in its food through the tiniest holes in its leaves he answered its breath is its food and it can't do it except in the daylight  thank you sir thank you returned diamond i'm sorry i couldn't find it out myself mr raymond would have been better pleased with me  but you needn't tell him any one told you  diamond gave him a stare which came from the very back of the north wind where that kind of thing is unknown  that would be cheating he said at last  ain't you a cabby then  cabbies don't cheat  don't they i am of a different opinion  i'm sure my father don't  what's your fare young innocent  well i think the distance is a good deal over three miles that's two shillings only father says sixpence a mile is too little though we can't ask for more  you're a deep one but i think you're wrong it's over four miles not much but it is  then that's half-a-crown said diamond  well here's three shillings will that do  thank you kindly sir i'll tell my father how good you were to me first to tell me my riddle then to put me right about the distance and then to give me sixpence over it'll help father to get well again it will  i hope it may my man i shouldn't wonder if you're as good as you look after all  as diamond returned he drew up at a stand he had never been on before  it was time to give diamond his bag of chopped beans and oats the men got about him and began to chaff him he took it all good-humouredly until one of them who was an ill-conditioned fellow began to tease old diamond by poking him roughly in the ribs and making general game of him that he could not bear and the tears came in his eyes he undid the nose-bag put it in the boot and was just going to mount and drive away when the fellow interfered and would not let him get up diamond endeavoured to persuade him and was very civil but he would have his fun out of him as he said in a few minutes a group of idle boys had assembled and diamond found himself in a very uncomfortable position another cab drew up at the stand and the driver got off and approached the assemblage  what's up here he asked and diamond knew the voice it was that of the drunken cabman  do you see this young oyster he pretends to drive a cab said his enemy  yes i do see him and i sees you too you'd better leave him alone he ain't no oyster he's a angel come down on his own business you be off or i'll be nearer you than quite agreeable  the drunken cabman was a tall stout man who did not look one to take liberties with  oh if he's a friend of yours said the other drawing back  diamond got out the nose-bag again old diamond should have his feed out now  yes he is a friend o' mine one o' the best i ever had it's a pity he ain't a friend o' yourn you'd be the better for it but it ain't no fault of hisn  when diamond went home at night he carried with him one pound one shilling and sixpence besides a few coppers extra which had followed some of the fares  his mother had got very anxious indeed so much so that she was almost afraid when she did hear the sound of his cab to go and look lest she should be yet again disappointed and should break down before her husband but there was the old horse and there was the cab all right and there was diamond in the box his pale face looking triumphant as a full moon in the twilight  when he drew up at the stable-door jack came out and after a good many friendly questions and congratulations said   you go in to your mother diamond i'll put up the old 'oss i'll take care on him he do deserve some small attention he do  thank you jack said diamond and bounded into the house and into the arms of his mother who was waiting him at the top of the stair  the poor anxious woman led him into his own room sat down on his bed took him on her lap as if he had been a baby and cried  how's father asked diamond almost afraid to ask  better my child she answered but uneasy about you my dear  didn't you tell him i was the early bird gone out to catch the worm  that was what put it in your head was it you monkey said his mother beginning to get better  that or something else answered diamond so very quietly that his mother held his head back and stared in his face  well of all the children she said and said no more  and here's my worm resumed diamond  but to see her face as he poured the shillings and sixpences and pence into her lap she burst out crying a second time and ran with the money to her husband  and how pleased he was it did him no end of good but while he was counting the coins diamond turned to baby who was lying awake in his cradle sucking his precious thumb and took him up saying   baby baby i haven't seen you for a whole year  and then he began to sing to him as usual and what he sang was this for he was too happy either to make a song of his own or to sing sense it was one out of mr raymond's book   the true story of the cat and the fiddle                 hey diddle diddle                the cat and the fiddle             he played such a merry tune                that the cow went mad                with the pleasure she had             and jumped right over the moon                but then don't you see                before that could be             the moon had come down and listened                the little dog hearkened                so loud that he barkened             there's nothing like it there isn't                 hey diddle diddle                went the cat and the fiddle             hey diddle diddle dee dee                the dog laughed at the sport                till his cough cut him short             it was hey diddle diddle oh me                and back came the cow                with a merry merry low             for she'd humbled the man in the moon                the dish got excited                the spoon was delighted             and the dish waltzed away with the spoon                 but the man in the moon                coming back too soon             from the famous town of norwich                caught up the dish                said it's just what i wish             to hold my cold plum-porridge                 gave the cow a rat-tat                flung water on the cat             and sent him away like a rocket                said o moon there you are                 got into her car             and went off with the spoon in his pocket                 hey ho  diddle diddle                the wet cat and wet fiddle             they made such a caterwauling                that the cow in a fright                stood bolt upright             bellowing now and bawling                and the dog on his tail                stretched his neck with a wail             but ho ho said the man in the moon                 no more in the south                shall i burn my mouth             for i've found a dish and a spoon     chapter xxv diamond's dream   there baby said diamond i'm so happy that i can only sing nonsense oh father think if you had been a poor man and hadn't had a cab and old diamond what should i have done  i don't know indeed what you could have done said his father from the bed  we should have all starved my precious diamond said his mother whose pride in her boy was even greater than her joy in the shillings both of them together made her heart ache for pleasure can do that as well as pain  oh no we shouldn't said diamond i could have taken nanny's crossing till she came back and then the money instead of going for old sal's gin would have gone for father's beef-tea i wonder what nanny will do when she gets well again somebody else will be sure to have taken the crossing by that time i wonder if she will fight for it and whether i shall have to help her i won't bother my head about that time enough yet hey diddle hey diddle hey diddle diddle i wonder whether mr raymond would take me to see nanny hey diddle hey diddle hey diddle diddle the baby and fiddle o mother i'm such a silly but i can't help it i wish i could think of something else but there's nothing will come into my head but hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle i wonder what the angels do when they're extra happy you know when they've been driving cabs all day and taking home the money to their mothers do you think they ever sing nonsense mother  i daresay they've got their own sort of it answered his mother else they wouldn't be like other people she was thinking more of her twenty-one shillings and sixpence and of the nice dinner she would get for her sick husband next day than of the angels and their nonsense when she said it but diamond found her answer all right  yes to be sure he replied they wouldn't be like other people if they hadn't their nonsense sometimes but it must be very pretty nonsense and not like that silly hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle i wish i could get it out of my head i wonder what the angels' nonsense is like nonsense is a very good thing ain't it mother a little of it now and then more of it for baby and not so much for grown people like cabmen and their mothers it's like the pepper and salt that goes in the soup that's it isn't it mother there's baby fast asleep oh what a nonsense baby it is to sleep so much shall i put him down mother  diamond chattered away what rose in his happy little heart ran out of his mouth and did his father and mother good when he went to bed which he did early being more tired as you may suppose than usual he was still thinking what the nonsense could be like which the angels sang when they were too happy to sing sense but before coming to any conclusion he fell fast asleep and no wonder for it must be acknowledged a difficult question  that night he had a very curious dream which i think my readers would like to have told them they would at least if they are as fond of nice dreams as i am and don't have enough of them of their own  he dreamed that he was running about in the twilight in the old garden he thought he was waiting for north wind but she did not come so he would run down to the back gate and see if she were there he ran and ran it was a good long garden out of his dream but in his dream it had grown so long and spread out so wide that the gate he wanted was nowhere he ran and ran but instead of coming to the gate found himself in a beautiful country not like any country he had ever been in before there were no trees of any size nothing bigger in fact than hawthorns which were full of may-blossom the place in which they grew was wild and dry mostly covered with grass but having patches of heath it extended on every side as far as he could see but although it was so wild yet wherever in an ordinary heath you might have expected furze bushes or holly or broom there grew roses wild and rare all kinds on every side far and near roses were glowing there too was the gum-cistus whose flowers fall every night and come again the next morning lilacs and syringas and laburnums and many shrubs besides of which he did not know the names but the roses were everywhere he wandered on and on wondering when it would come to an end it was of no use going back for there was no house to be seen anywhere but he was not frightened for you know diamond was used to things that were rather out of the way he threw himself down under a rose-bush and fell asleep  he woke not out of his dream but into it thinking he heard a child's voice calling diamond diamond he jumped up but all was still about him the rose-bushes were pouring out their odours in clouds he could see the scent like mists of the same colour as the rose issuing like a slow fountain and spreading in the air till it joined the thin rosy vapour which hung over all the wilderness but again came the voice calling him and it seemed to come from over his head he looked up but saw only the deep blue sky full of stars more brilliant however than he had seen them before and both sky and stars looked nearer to the earth  while he gazed up again he heard the cry at the same moment he saw one of the biggest stars over his head give a kind of twinkle and jump as if it went out and came in again he threw himself on his back and fixed his eyes upon it nor had he gazed long before it went out leaving something like a scar in the blue but as he went on gazing he saw a face where the star had been a merry face with bright eyes the eyes appeared not only to see diamond but to know that diamond had caught sight of them for the face withdrew the same moment again came the voice calling diamond diamond and in jumped the star to its place  diamond called as loud as he could right up into the sky   here's diamond down below you what do you want him to do  the next instant many of the stars round about that one went out and many voices shouted from the sky   come up come up we're so jolly diamond diamond  this was followed by a peal of the merriest kindliest laughter and all the stars jumped into their places again  how am i to come up shouted diamond  go round the rose-bush it's got its foot in it said the first voice  diamond got up at once and walked to the other side of the rose-bush  there he found what seemed the very opposite of what he wanted a stair down into the earth it was of turf and moss it did not seem to promise well for getting into the sky but diamond had learned to look through the look of things the voice must have meant that he was to go down this stair and down this stair diamond went without waiting to think more about it  it was such a nice stair so cool and soft all the sides as well as the steps grown with moss and grass and ferns down and down diamond went a long way until at last he heard the gurgling and splashing of a little stream nor had he gone much farther before he met it yes met it coming up the stairs to meet him running up just as naturally as if it had been doing the other thing neither was diamond in the least surprised to see it pitching itself from one step to another as it climbed towards him  he never thought it was odd and no more it was there it would have been odd here it made a merry tune as it came and its voice was like the laughter he had heard from the sky this appeared promising and he went on down and down the stair and up and up the stream till at last he came where it hurried out from under a stone and the stair stopped altogether and as the stream bubbled up the stone shook and swayed with its force and diamond thought he would try to lift it lightly it rose to his hand forced up by the stream from below and by what would have seemed an unaccountable perversion of things had he been awake threatened to come tumbling upon his head but he avoided it and when it fell got upon it he now saw that the opening through which the water came pouring in was over his head and with the help of the stone he scrambled out by it and found himself on the side of a grassy hill which rounded away from him in every direction and down which came the brook which vanished in the hole but scarcely had he noticed so much as this before a merry shouting and laughter burst upon him and a number of naked little boys came running every one eager to get to him first at the shoulders of each fluttered two little wings which were of no use for flying as they were mere buds only being made for it they could not help fluttering as if they were flying just as the foremost of the troop reached him one or two of them fell and the rest with shouts of laughter came tumbling over them till they heaped up a mound of struggling merriment one after another they extricated themselves and each as he got free threw his arms round diamond and kissed him diamond's heart was ready to melt within him from clear delight when they had all embraced him   now let us have some fun cried one and with a shout they all scampered hither and thither and played the wildest gambols on the grassy slopes they kept constantly coming back to diamond however as the centre of their enjoyment rejoicing over him as if they had found a lost playmate  there was a wind on the hillside which blew like the very embodiment of living gladness it blew into diamond's heart and made him so happy that he was forced to sit down and cry  now let's go and dig for stars said one who seemed to be the captain of the troop  they all scurried away but soon returned one after another each with a pickaxe on his shoulder and a spade in his hand as soon as they were gathered the captain led them in a straight line to another part of the hill diamond rose and followed  here is where we begin our lesson for to-night he said scatter and dig  there was no more fun each went by himself walking slowly with bent shoulders and his eyes fixed on the ground every now and then one would stop kneel down and look intently feeling with his hands and parting the grass one would get up and walk on again another spring to his feet catch eagerly at his pickaxe and strike it into the ground once and again then throw it aside snatch up his spade and commence digging at the loosened earth now one would sorrowfully shovel the earth into the hole again trample it down with his little bare white feet and walk on but another would give a joyful shout and after much tugging and loosening would draw from the hole a lump as big as his head or no bigger than his fist when the under side of it would pour such a blaze of golden or bluish light into diamond's eyes that he was quite dazzled gold and blue were the commoner colours  the jubilation was greater over red or green or purple and every time a star was dug up all the little angels dropped their tools and crowded about it shouting and dancing and fluttering their wing-buds  when they had examined it well they would kneel down one after the other and peep through the hole but they always stood back to give diamond the first look all that diamond could report however was that through the star-holes he saw a great many things and places and people he knew quite well only somehow they were different there was something marvellous about them he could not tell what every time he rose from looking through a star-hole he felt as if his heart would break for joy and he said that if he had not cried he did not know what would have become of him  as soon as all had looked the star was carefully fitted in again a little mould was strewn over it and the rest of the heap left as a sign that the star had been discovered  at length one dug up a small star of a most lovely colour a colour diamond had never seen before the moment the angel saw what it was instead of showing it about he handed it to one of his neighbours and seated himself on the edge of the hole saying   this will do for me good-bye i'm off  they crowded about him hugging and kissing him then stood back with a solemn stillness their wings lying close to their shoulders the little fellow looked round on them once with a smile and then shot himself headlong through the star-hole diamond as privileged threw himself on the ground to peep after him but he saw nothing it's no use said the captain i never saw anything more of one that went that way  his wings can't be much use said diamond concerned and fearful yet comforted by the calm looks of the rest  that's true said the captain he's lost them by this time they all do that go that way you haven't got any you see  no said diamond i never did have any  oh didn't you said the captain  some people say he added after a pause that they come again i don't know i've never found the colour i care about myself i suppose i shall some day  then they looked again at the star put it carefully into its hole danced around it and over it but solemnly and called it by the name of the finder  will you know it again asked diamond  oh yes we never forget a star that's been made a door of  then they went on with their searching and digging  diamond having neither pickaxe nor spade had the more time to think  i don't see any little girls he said at last  the captain stopped his shovelling leaned on his spade rubbed his forehead thoughtfully with his left hand the little angels were all left-handed repeated the words little girls and then as if a thought had struck him resumed his work saying   i think i know what you mean i've never seen any of them of course but i suppose that's the sort you mean i'm told but mind i don't say it is so for i don't know that when we fall asleep a troop of angels very like ourselves only quite different goes round to all the stars we have discovered and discovers them after us i suppose with our shovelling and handling we spoil them a bit and i daresay the clouds that come up from below make them smoky and dull sometimes they say mind i say they say these other angels take them out one by one and pass each round as we do and breathe over it and rub it with their white hands which are softer than ours because they don't do any pick-and-spade work and smile at it and put it in again  and that is what keeps them from growing dark  how jolly thought diamond i should like to see them at their work too when do you go to sleep he asked the captain  when we grow sleepy answered the captain they do say but mind i say they say that it is when those others what do you call them i don't know if that is their name i am only guessing that may be the sort you mean when they are on their rounds and come near any troop of us we fall asleep they live on the west side of the hill none of us have ever been to the top of it yet  even as he spoke he dropped his spade he tumbled down beside it and lay fast asleep one after the other each of the troop dropped his pickaxe or shovel from his listless hands and lay fast asleep by his work  ah thought diamond to himself with delight now the girl-angels are coming and i not being an angel shall not fall asleep like the rest and i shall see the girl-angels  but the same moment he felt himself growing sleepy he struggled hard with the invading power he put up his fingers to his eyelids and pulled them open but it was of no use he thought he saw a glimmer of pale rosy light far up the green hill and ceased to know  when he awoke all the angels were starting up wide awake too he expected to see them lift their tools but no the time for play had come they looked happier than ever and each began to sing where he stood he had not heard them sing before  now he thought i shall know what kind of nonsense the angels sing when they are merry they don't drive cabs i see but they dig for stars and they work hard enough to be merry after it  and he did hear some of the angels' nonsense for if it was all sense to them it had only just as much sense to diamond as made good nonsense of it he tried hard to set it down in his mind listening as closely as he could now to one now to another and now to all together but while they were yet singing he began to his dismay to find that he was coming awake faster and faster and as he came awake he found that for all the goodness of his memory verse after verse of the angels' nonsense vanished from it he always thought he could keep the last but as the next began he lost the one before it and at length awoke struggling to keep hold of the last verse of all he felt as if the effort to keep from forgetting that one verse of the vanishing song nearly killed him and yet by the time he was wide awake he could not be sure of that even it was something like this             white hands of whiteness            wash the stars' faces          till glitter glitter glit goes their brightness            down to poor places   this however was so near sense that he thought it could not be really what they did sing     chapter xxvi diamond takes a fare the wrong way right   the next morning diamond was up almost as early as before he had nothing to fear from his mother now and made no secret of what he was about by the time he reached the stable several of the men were there they asked him a good many questions as to his luck the day before and he told them all they wanted to know but when he proceeded to harness the old horse they pushed him aside with rough kindness called him a baby and began to do it all for him so diamond ran in and had another mouthful of tea and bread and butter and although he had never been so tired as he was the night before he started quite fresh this morning it was a cloudy day and the wind blew hard from the north so hard sometimes that perched on the box with just his toes touching the ground diamond wished that he had some kind of strap to fasten himself down with lest he should be blown away but he did not really mind it  his head was full of the dream he had dreamed but it did not make him neglect his work for his work was not to dig stars but to drive old diamond and pick up fares there are not many people who can think about beautiful things and do common work at the same time but then there are not many people who have been to the back of the north wind  there was not much business doing and diamond felt rather cold notwithstanding his mother had herself put on his comforter and helped him with his greatcoat but he was too well aware of his dignity to get inside his cab as some do a cabman ought to be above minding the weather at least so diamond thought at length he was called to a neighbouring house where a young woman with a heavy box had to be taken to wapping for a coast-steamer  he did not find it at all pleasant so far east and so near the river for the roughs were in great force however there being no block not even in nightingale lane he reached the entrance of the wharf and set down his passenger without annoyance but as he turned to go back some idlers not content with chaffing him showed a mind to the fare the young woman had given him they were just pulling him off the box and diamond was shouting for the police when a pale-faced man in very shabby clothes but with the look of a gentleman somewhere about him came up and making good use of his stick drove them off  now my little man he said get on while you can don't lose any time this is not a place for you  but diamond was not in the habit of thinking only of himself he saw that his new friend looked weary if not ill and very poor  won't you jump in sir he said i will take you wherever you like  thank you my man but i have no money so i can't  oh i don't want any money i shall be much happier if you will get in you have saved me all i had i owe you a lift sir  which way are you going  to charing cross but i don't mind where i go  well i am very tired if you will take me to charing cross i shall be greatly obliged to you i have walked from gravesend and had hardly a penny left to get through the tunnel  so saying he opened the door and got in and diamond drove away  but as he drove he could not help fancying he had seen the gentleman for diamond knew he was a gentleman before do all he could however he could not recall where or when meantime his fare if we may call him such seeing he was to pay nothing whom the relief of being carried had made less and less inclined to carry himself had been turning over things in his mind and as they passed the mint called to diamond who stopped the horse got down and went to the window  if you didn't mind taking me to chiswick i should be able to pay you when we got there it's a long way but you shall have the whole fare from the docks and something over  very well sir said diamond i shall be most happy  he was just clambering up again when the gentleman put his head out of the window and said   it's the wilderness mr coleman's place but i'll direct you when we come into the neighbourhood  it flashed upon diamond who he was but he got upon his box to arrange his thoughts before making any reply  the gentleman was mr evans to whom miss coleman was to have been married and diamond had seen him several times with her in the garden i have said that he had not behaved very well to miss coleman he had put off their marriage more than once in a cowardly fashion merely because he was ashamed to marry upon a small income and live in a humble way when a man thinks of what people will say in such a case he may love but his love is but a poor affair mr coleman took him into the firm as a junior partner and it was in a measure through his influence that he entered upon those speculations which ruined him so his love had not been a blessing the ship which north wind had sunk was their last venture and mr evans had gone out with it in the hope of turning its cargo to the best advantage he was one of the single boat-load which managed to reach a desert island and he had gone through a great many hardships and sufferings since then but he was not past being taught and his troubles had done him no end of good for they had made him doubt himself and begin to think so that he had come to see that he had been foolish as well as wicked for if he had had miss coleman with him in the desert island to build her a hut and hunt for her food and make clothes for her he would have thought himself the most fortunate of men and when he was at home he would not marry till he could afford a man-servant before he got home again he had even begun to understand that no man can make haste to be rich without going against the will of god in which case it is the one frightful thing to be successful so he had come back a more humble man and longing to ask miss coleman to forgive him but he had no idea what ruin had fallen upon them for he had never made himself thoroughly acquainted with the firm's affairs few speculative people do know their own affairs hence he never doubted he should find matters much as he left them and expected to see them all at the wilderness as before but if he had not fallen in with diamond he would not have thought of going there first  what was diamond to do he had heard his father and mother drop some remarks concerning mr evans which made him doubtful of him he understood that he had not been so considerate as he might have been so he went rather slowly till he should make up his mind it was of course of no use to drive mr evans to chiswick but if he should tell him what had befallen them and where they lived now he might put off going to see them and he was certain that miss coleman at least must want very much to see mr evans he was pretty sure also that the best thing in any case was to bring them together and let them set matters right for themselves  the moment he came to this conclusion he changed his course from westward to northward and went straight for mr coleman's poor little house in hoxton mr evans was too tired and too much occupied with his thoughts to take the least notice of the streets they passed through and had no suspicion therefore of the change of direction  by this time the wind had increased almost to a hurricane and as they had often to head it it was no joke for either of the diamonds the distance however was not great before they reached the street where mr coleman lived it blew so tremendously that when miss coleman who was going out a little way opened the door it dashed against the wall with such a bang that she was afraid to venture and went in again in five minutes after diamond drew up at the door as soon as he had entered the street however the wind blew right behind them and when he pulled up old diamond had so much ado to stop the cab against it that the breeching broke young diamond jumped off his box knocked loudly at the door then turned to the cab and said before mr evans had quite begun to think something must be amiss   please sir my harness has given away would you mind stepping in here for a few minutes they're friends of mine i'll take you where you like after i've got it mended i shan't be many minutes but you can't stand in this wind  half stupid with fatigue and want of food mr evans yielded to the boy's suggestion and walked in at the door which the maid held with difficulty against the wind she took mr evans for a visitor as indeed he was and showed him into the room on the ground-floor diamond who had followed into the hall whispered to her as she closed the door   tell miss coleman it's miss coleman he wants to see  i don't know said the maid he don't look much like a gentleman  he is though and i know him and so does miss coleman  the maid could not but remember diamond having seen him when he and his father brought the ladies home so she believed him and went to do what he told her  what passed in the little parlour when miss coleman came down does not belong to my story which is all about diamond if he had known that miss coleman thought mr evans was dead perhaps he would have managed differently there was a cry and a running to and fro in the house and then all was quiet again  almost as soon as mr evans went in the wind began to cease and was now still diamond found that by making the breeching just a little tighter than was quite comfortable for the old horse he could do very well for the present and thinking it better to let him have his bag in this quiet place he sat on the box till the old horse should have eaten his dinner in a little while mr evans came out and asked him to come in diamond obeyed and to his delight miss coleman put her arms round him and kissed him and there was payment for him not to mention the five precious shillings she gave him which he could not refuse because his mother wanted them so much at home for his father he left them nearly as happy as they were themselves  the rest of the day he did better and although he had not so much to take home as the day before yet on the whole the result was satisfactory and what a story he had to tell his father and mother about his adventures and how he had done and what was the result they asked him such a multitude of questions some of which he could answer and some of which he could not answer and his father seemed ever so much better from finding that his boy was already not only useful to his family but useful to other people and quite taking his place as a man who judged what was wise and did work worth doing  for a fortnight diamond went on driving his cab and keeping his family he had begun to be known about some parts of london and people would prefer taking his cab because they liked what they heard of him one gentleman who lived near the mews engaged him to carry him to the city every morning at a certain hour and diamond was punctual as clockwork though to effect that required a good deal of care for his father's watch was not much to be depended on and had to be watched itself by the clock of st george's church between the two however he did make a success of it  after that fortnight his father was able to go out again then diamond went to make inquiries about nanny and this led to something else     chapter xxvii the children's hospital   the first day his father resumed his work diamond went with him as usual in the afternoon however his father having taken a fare to the neighbourhood went home and diamond drove the cab the rest of the day it was hard for old diamond to do all the work but they could not afford to have another horse they contrived to save him as much as possible and fed him well and he did bravely  the next morning his father was so much stronger that diamond thought he might go and ask mr raymond to take him to see nanny he found him at home his servant had grown friendly by this time and showed him in without any cross-questioning mr raymond received him with his usual kindness consented at once and walked with him to the hospital which was close at hand it was a comfortable old-fashioned house built in the reign of queen anne and in her day no doubt inhabited by rich and fashionable people  now it was a home for poor sick children who were carefully tended for love's sake there are regions in london where a hospital in every other street might be full of such children whose fathers and mothers are dead or unable to take care of them  when diamond followed mr raymond into the room where those children who had got over the worst of their illness and were growing better lay he saw a number of little iron bedsteads with their heads to the walls and in every one of them a child whose face was a story in itself in some health had begun to appear in a tinge upon the cheeks and a doubtful brightness in the eyes just as out of the cold dreary winter the spring comes in blushing buds and bright crocuses in others there were more of the signs of winter left their faces reminded you of snow and keen cutting winds more than of sunshine and soft breezes and butterflies but even in them the signs of suffering told that the suffering was less and that if the spring-time had but arrived it had yet arrived  diamond looked all round but could see no nanny he turned to mr raymond with a question in his eyes  well said mr raymond  nanny's not here said diamond  oh yes she is  i don't see her  i do though there she is  he pointed to a bed right in front of where diamond was standing  that's not nanny he said  it is nanny i have seen her many times since you have illness makes a great difference  why that girl must have been to the back of the north wind thought diamond but he said nothing only stared and as he stared something of the old nanny began to dawn through the face of the new nanny the old nanny though a good girl and a friendly girl had been rough blunt in her speech and dirty in her person her face would always have reminded one who had already been to the back of the north wind of something he had seen in the best of company but it had been coarse notwithstanding partly from the weather partly from her living amongst low people and partly from having to defend herself  now it was so sweet and gentle and refined that she might have had a lady and gentleman for a father and mother and diamond could not help thinking of words which he had heard in the church the day before  surely it is good to be afflicted or something like that north wind somehow or other must have had to do with her she had grown from a rough girl into a gentle maiden  mr raymond however was not surprised for he was used to see such lovely changes something like the change which passes upon the crawling many-footed creature when it turns sick and ill and revives a butterfly with two wings instead of many feet instead of her having to take care of herself kind hands ministered to her making her comfortable and sweet and clean soothing her aching head and giving her cooling drink when she was thirsty and kind eyes the stars of the kingdom of heaven had shone upon her so that what with the fire of the fever and the dew of tenderness that which was coarse in her had melted away and her whole face had grown so refined and sweet that diamond did not know her but as he gazed the best of the old face all the true and good part of it that which was nanny herself dawned upon him like the moon coming out of a cloud until at length instead of only believing mr raymond that this was she he saw for himself that it was nanny indeed very worn but grown beautiful  he went up to her she smiled he had heard her laugh but had never seen her smile before  nanny do you know me said diamond  she only smiled again as if the question was amusing  she was not likely to forget him for although she did not yet know it was he who had got her there she had dreamed of him often and had talked much about him when delirious nor was it much wonder for he was the only boy except joe who had ever shown her kindness  meantime mr raymond was going from bed to bed talking to the little people every one knew him and every one was eager to have a look and a smile and a kind word from him  diamond sat down on a stool at the head of nanny's bed she laid her hand in his no one else of her old acquaintance had been near her  suddenly a little voice called aloud   won't mr raymond tell us a story  oh yes please do please do cried several little voices which also were stronger than the rest for mr raymond was in the habit of telling them a story when he went to see them and they enjoyed it far more than the other nice things which the doctor permitted him to give them  very well said mr raymond i will what sort of a story shall it be  a true story said one little girl  a fairy tale said a little boy  well said mr raymond i suppose as there is a difference i may choose i can't think of any true story just at this moment so i will tell you a sort of a fairy one  oh jolly exclaimed the little boy who had called out for a fairy tale  it came into my head this morning as i got out of bed continued mr raymond and if it turns out pretty well i will write it down and get somebody to print it for me and then you shall read it when you like  then nobody ever heard it before asked one older child  no nobody  oh exclaimed several thinking it very grand to have the first telling and i daresay there might be a peculiar freshness about it because everything would be nearly as new to the story-teller himself as to the listeners  some were only sitting up and some were lying down so there could not be the same busy gathering bustling and shifting to and fro with which children generally prepare themselves to hear a story but their faces and the turning of their heads and many feeble exclamations of expected pleasure showed that all such preparations were making within them  mr raymond stood in the middle of the room that he might turn from side to side and give each a share of seeing him diamond kept his place by nanny's side with her hand in his i do not know how much of mr raymond's story the smaller children understood indeed i don't quite know how much there was in it to be understood for in such a story every one has just to take what he can get but they all listened with apparent satisfaction and certainly with great attention mr raymond wrote it down afterwards and here it is somewhat altered no doubt for a good story-teller tries to make his stories better every time he tells them i cannot myself help thinking that he was somewhat indebted for this one to the old story of the sleeping beauty     chapter xxviii little daylight   no house of any pretension to be called a palace is in the least worthy of the name except it has a wood near it very near it and the nearer the better not all round it i don't mean that for a palace ought to be open to the sun and wind and stand high and brave with weathercocks glittering and flags flying but on one side of every palace there must be a wood and there was a very grand wood indeed beside the palace of the king who was going to be daylight's father such a grand wood that nobody yet had ever got to the other end of it near the house it was kept very trim and nice and it was free of brushwood for a long way in but by degrees it got wild and it grew wilder and wilder and wilder until some said wild beasts at last did what they liked in it the king and his courtiers often hunted however and this kept the wild beasts far away from the palace  one glorious summer morning when the wind and sun were out together when the vanes were flashing and the flags frolicking against the blue sky little daylight made her appearance from somewhere nobody could tell where a beautiful baby with such bright eyes that she might have come from the sun only by and by she showed such lively ways that she might equally well have come out of the wind there was great jubilation in the palace for this was the first baby the queen had had and there is as much happiness over a new baby in a palace as in a cottage  but there is one disadvantage of living near a wood  you do not know quite who your neighbours may be everybody knew there were in it several fairies living within a few miles of the palace who always had had something to do with each new baby that came for fairies live so much longer than we that they can have business with a good many generations of human mortals the curious houses they lived in were well known also one a hollow oak another a birch-tree though nobody could ever find how that fairy made a house of it another a hut of growing trees intertwined and patched up with turf and moss but there was another fairy who had lately come to the place and nobody even knew she was a fairy except the other fairies a wicked old thing she was always concealing her power and being as disagreeable as she could in order to tempt people to give her offence that she might have the pleasure of taking vengeance upon them the people about thought she was a witch and those who knew her by sight were careful to avoid offending her she lived in a mud house in a swampy part of the forest  in all history we find that fairies give their remarkable gifts to prince or princess or any child of sufficient importance in their eyes always at the christening now this we can understand because it is an ancient custom amongst human beings as well and it is not hard to explain why wicked fairies should choose the same time to do unkind things but it is difficult to understand how they should be able to do them for you would fancy all wicked creatures would be powerless on such an occasion but i never knew of any interference on the part of the wicked fairy that did not turn out a good thing in the end what a good thing for instance it was that one princess should sleep for a hundred years was she not saved from all the plague of young men who were not worthy of her and did she not come awake exactly at the right moment when the right prince kissed her for my part i cannot help wishing a good many girls would sleep till just the same fate overtook them it would be happier for them and more agreeable to their friends  of course all the known fairies were invited to the christening but the king and queen never thought of inviting an old witch  for the power of the fairies they have by nature whereas a witch gets her power by wickedness the other fairies however knowing the danger thus run provided as well as they could against accidents from her quarter but they could neither render her powerless nor could they arrange their gifts in reference to hers beforehand for they could not tell what those might be  of course the old hag was there without being asked not to be asked was just what she wanted that she might have a sort of reason for doing what she wished to do for somehow even the wickedest of creatures likes a pretext for doing the wrong thing  five fairies had one after the other given the child such gifts as each counted best and the fifth had just stepped back to her place in the surrounding splendour of ladies and gentlemen when mumbling a laugh between her toothless gums the wicked fairy hobbled out into the middle of the circle and at the moment when the archbishop was handing the baby to the lady at the head of the nursery department of state affairs addressed him thus giving a bite or two to every word before she could part with it   please your grace i'm very deaf  would your grace mind repeating the princess's name  with pleasure my good woman said the archbishop stooping to shout in her ear  the infant's name is little daylight  and little daylight it shall be cried the fairy in the tone of a dry axle and little good shall any of her gifts do her for i bestow upon her the gift of sleeping all day long whether she will or not ha ha he he hi hi  then out started the sixth fairy who of course the others had arranged should come after the wicked one in order to undo as much as she might  if she sleep all day she said mournfully she shall at least wake all night  a nice prospect for her mother and me thought the poor king for they loved her far too much to give her up to nurses especially at night as most kings and queens do and are sorry for it afterwards  you spoke before i had done said the wicked fairy that's against the law it gives me another chance  i beg your pardon said the other fairies all together  she did i hadn't done laughing said the crone i had only got to hi hi and i had to go through ho ho and hu hu so i decree that if she wakes all night she shall wax and wane with its mistress the moon and what that may mean i hope her royal parents will live to see ho ho hu hu  but out stepped another fairy for they had been wise enough to keep two in reserve because every fairy knew the trick of one  until said the seventh fairy a prince comes who shall kiss her without knowing it  the wicked fairy made a horrid noise like an angry cat and hobbled away she could not pretend that she had not finished her speech this time for she had laughed ho ho and hu hu  i don't know what that means said the poor king to the seventh fairy  don't be afraid the meaning will come with the thing itself said she  the assembly broke up miserable enough the queen at least prepared for a good many sleepless nights and the lady at the head of the nursery department anything but comfortable in the prospect before her for of course the queen could not do it all as for the king he made up his mind with what courage he could summon to meet the demands of the case but wondered whether he could with any propriety require the first lord of the treasury to take a share in the burden laid upon him  i will not attempt to describe what they had to go through for some time but at last the household settled into a regular system a very irregular one in some respects for at certain seasons the palace rang all night with bursts of laughter from little daylight whose heart the old fairy's curse could not reach she was daylight still only a little in the wrong place for she always dropped asleep at the first hint of dawn in the east but her merriment was of short duration when the moon was at the full she was in glorious spirits and as beautiful as it was possible for a child of her age to be but as the moon waned she faded until at last she was wan and withered like the poorest sickliest child you might come upon in the streets of a great city in the arms of a homeless mother then the night was quiet as the day for the little creature lay in her gorgeous cradle night and day with hardly a motion and indeed at last without even a moan like one dead at first they often thought she was dead but at last they got used to it and only consulted the almanac to find the moment when she would begin to revive which of course was with the first appearance of the silver thread of the crescent moon then she would move her lips and they would give her a little nourishment and she would grow better and better and better until for a few days she was splendidly well when well she was always merriest out in the moonlight but even when near her worst she seemed better when in warm summer nights they carried her cradle out into the light of the waning moon then in her sleep she would smile the faintest most pitiful smile  for a long time very few people ever saw her awake as she grew older she became such a favourite however that about the palace there were always some who would contrive to keep awake at night in order to be near her but she soon began to take every chance of getting away from her nurses and enjoying her moonlight alone and thus things went on until she was nearly seventeen years of age her father and mother had by that time got so used to the odd state of things that they had ceased to wonder at them all their arrangements had reference to the state of the princess daylight and it is amazing how things contrive to accommodate themselves but how any prince was ever to find and deliver her appeared inconceivable  as she grew older she had grown more and more beautiful with the sunniest hair and the loveliest eyes of heavenly blue brilliant and profound as the sky of a june day but so much more painful and sad was the change as her bad time came on the more beautiful she was in the full moon the more withered and worn did she become as the moon waned at the time at which my story has now arrived she looked when the moon was small or gone like an old woman exhausted with suffering this was the more painful that her appearance was unnatural for her hair and eyes did not change her wan face was both drawn and wrinkled and had an eager hungry look her skinny hands moved as if wishing but unable to lay hold of something her shoulders were bent forward her chest went in and she stooped as if she were eighty years old at last she had to be put to bed and there await the flow of the tide of life but she grew to dislike being seen still more being touched by any hands during this season one lovely summer evening when the moon lay all but gone upon the verge of the horizon she vanished from her attendants and it was only after searching for her a long time in great terror that they found her fast asleep in the forest at the foot of a silver birch and carried her home  a little way from the palace there was a great open glade covered with the greenest and softest grass this was her favourite haunt for here the full moon shone free and glorious while through a vista in the trees she could generally see more or less of the dying moon as it crossed the opening here she had a little rustic house built for her and here she mostly resided none of the court might go there without leave and her own attendants had learned by this time not to be officious in waiting upon her so that she was very much at liberty whether the good fairies had anything to do with it or not i cannot tell but at last she got into the way of retreating further into the wood every night as the moon waned so that sometimes they had great trouble in finding her but as she was always very angry if she discovered they were watching her they scarcely dared to do so at length one night they thought they had lost her altogether it was morning before they found her feeble as she was she had wandered into a thicket a long way from the glade and there she lay fast asleep of course  although the fame of her beauty and sweetness had gone abroad yet as everybody knew she was under a bad spell no king in the neighbourhood had any desire to have her for a daughter-in-law there were serious objections to such a relation  about this time in a neighbouring kingdom in consequence of the wickedness of the nobles an insurrection took place upon the death of the old king the greater part of the nobility was massacred and the young prince was compelled to flee for his life disguised like a peasant for some time until he got out of the country he suffered much from hunger and fatigue but when he got into that ruled by the princess's father and had no longer any fear of being recognised he fared better for the people were kind he did not abandon his disguise however one tolerable reason was that he had no other clothes to put on and another that he had very little money and did not know where to get any more there was no good in telling everybody he met that he was a prince for he felt that a prince ought to be able to get on like other people else his rank only made a fool of him he had read of princes setting out upon adventure and here he was out in similar case only without having had a choice in the matter he would go on and see what would come of it  for a day or two he had been walking through the palace-wood and had had next to nothing to eat when he came upon the strangest little house inhabited by a very nice tidy motherly old woman this was one of the good fairies the moment she saw him she knew quite well who he was and what was going to come of it but she was not at liberty to interfere with the orderly march of events she received him with the kindness she would have shown to any other traveller and gave him bread and milk which he thought the most delicious food he had ever tasted wondering that they did not have it for dinner at the palace sometimes the old woman pressed him to stay all night when he awoke he was amazed to find how well and strong he felt she would not take any of the money he offered but begged him if he found occasion of continuing in the neighbourhood to return and occupy the same quarters  thank you much good mother answered the prince but there is little chance of that the sooner i get out of this wood the better  i don't know that said the fairy  what do you mean asked the prince  why how should i know returned she  i can't tell said the prince  very well said the fairy  how strangely you talk said the prince  do i said the fairy  yes you do said the prince  very well said the fairy  the prince was not used to be spoken to in this fashion so he felt a little angry and turned and walked away but this did not offend the fairy she stood at the door of her little house looking after him till the trees hid him quite then she said at last and went in  the prince wandered and wandered and got nowhere the sun sank and sank and went out of sight and he seemed no nearer the end of the wood than ever he sat down on a fallen tree ate a bit of bread the old woman had given him and waited for the moon for although he was not much of an astronomer he knew the moon would rise some time because she had risen the night before up she came slow and slow but of a good size pretty nearly round indeed whereupon greatly refreshed with his piece of bread he got up and went he knew not whither  after walking a considerable distance he thought he was coming to the outside of the forest but when he reached what he thought the last of it he found himself only upon the edge of a great open space in it covered with grass the moon shone very bright and he thought he had never seen a more lovely spot still it looked dreary because of its loneliness for he could not see the house at the other side he sat down weary again and gazed into the glade he had not seen so much room for several days  all at once he spied something in the middle of the grass what could it be it moved it came nearer was it a human creature gliding across a girl dressed in white gleaming in the moonshine she came nearer and nearer he crept behind a tree and watched wondering it must be some strange being of the wood a nymph whom the moonlight and the warm dusky air had enticed from her tree but when she came close to where he stood he no longer doubted she was human for he had caught sight of her sunny hair and her clear blue eyes and the loveliest face and form that he had ever seen all at once she began singing like a nightingale and dancing to her own music with her eyes ever turned towards the moon she passed close to where he stood dancing on by the edge of the trees and away in a great circle towards the other side until he could see but a spot of white in the yellowish green of the moonlit grass but when he feared it would vanish quite the spot grew and became a figure once more she approached him again singing and dancing and waving her arms over her head until she had completed the circle just opposite his tree she stood ceased her song dropped her arms and broke out into a long clear laugh musical as a brook then as if tired she threw herself on the grass and lay gazing at the moon the prince was almost afraid to breathe lest he should startle her and she should vanish from his sight as to venturing near her that never came into his head  she had lain for a long hour or longer when the prince began again to doubt concerning her perhaps she was but a vision of his own fancy or was she a spirit of the wood after all if so he too would haunt the wood glad to have lost kingdom and everything for the hope of being near her he would build him a hut in the forest and there he would live for the pure chance of seeing her again upon nights like this at least she would come out and bask in the moonlight and make his soul blessed but while he thus dreamed she sprang to her feet turned her face full to the moon and began singing as she would draw her down from the sky by the power of her entrancing voice she looked more beautiful than ever again she began dancing to her own music and danced away into the distance once more she returned in a similar manner but although he was watching as eagerly as before what with fatigue and what with gazing he fell fast asleep before she came near him when he awoke it was broad daylight and the princess was nowhere  he could not leave the place what if she should come the next night he would gladly endure a day's hunger to see her yet again  he would buckle his belt quite tight he walked round the glade to see if he could discover any prints of her feet but the grass was so short and her steps had been so light that she had not left a single trace behind her he walked half-way round the wood without seeing anything to account for her presence then he spied a lovely little house with thatched roof and low eaves surrounded by an exquisite garden with doves and peacocks walking in it of course this must be where the gracious lady who loved the moonlight lived forgetting his appearance he walked towards the door determined to make inquiries but as he passed a little pond full of gold and silver fishes he caught sight of himself and turned to find the door to the kitchen there he knocked and asked for a piece of bread the good-natured cook brought him in and gave him an excellent breakfast which the prince found nothing the worse for being served in the kitchen while he ate he talked with his entertainer and learned that this was the favourite retreat of the princess daylight but he learned nothing more both because he was afraid of seeming inquisitive and because the cook did not choose to be heard talking about her mistress to a peasant lad who had begged for his breakfast  as he rose to take his leave it occurred to him that he might not be so far from the old woman's cottage as he had thought and he asked the cook whether she knew anything of such a place describing it as well as he could she said she knew it well enough adding with a smile   it's there you're going is it  yes if it's not far off  it's not more than three miles but mind what you are about you know  why do you say that  if you're after any mischief she'll make you repent it  the best thing that could happen under the circumstances remarked the prince  what do you mean by that asked the cook  why it stands to reason answered the prince that if you wish to do anything wrong the best thing for you is to be made to repent of it  i see said the cook well i think you may venture she's a good old soul  which way does it lie from here asked the prince  she gave him full instructions and he left her with many thanks  being now refreshed however the prince did not go back to the cottage that day  he remained in the forest amusing himself as best he could but waiting anxiously for the night in the hope that the princess would again appear nor was he disappointed for directly the moon rose he spied a glimmering shape far across the glade as it drew nearer he saw it was she indeed not dressed in white as before  in a pale blue like the sky she looked lovelier still he thought it was that the blue suited her yet better than the white he did not know that she was really more beautiful because the moon was nearer the full in fact the next night was full moon and the princess would then be at the zenith of her loveliness  the prince feared for some time that she was not coming near his hiding-place that night but the circles in her dance ever widened as the moon rose until at last they embraced the whole glade and she came still closer to the trees where he was hiding than she had come the night before he was entranced with her loveliness for it was indeed a marvellous thing all night long he watched her but dared not go near her he would have been ashamed of watching her too had he not become almost incapable of thinking of anything but how beautiful she was he watched the whole night long and saw that as the moon went down she retreated in smaller and smaller circles until at last he could see her no more  weary as he was he set out for the old woman's cottage where he arrived just in time for her breakfast which she shared with him he then went to bed and slept for many hours when he awoke the sun was down and he departed in great anxiety lest he should lose a glimpse of the lovely vision but whether it was by the machinations of the swamp-fairy or merely that it is one thing to go and another to return by the same road he lost his way i shall not attempt to describe his misery when the moon rose and he saw nothing but trees trees trees  she was high in the heavens before he reached the glade then indeed his troubles vanished for there was the princess coming dancing towards him in a dress that shone like gold and with shoes that glimmered through the grass like fireflies she was of course still more beautiful than before like an embodied sunbeam she passed him and danced away into the distance  before she returned in her circle the clouds had begun to gather about the moon the wind rose the trees moaned and their lighter branches leaned all one way before it the prince feared that the princess would go in and he should see her no more that night but she came dancing on more jubilant than ever her golden dress and her sunny hair streaming out upon the blast waving her arms towards the moon and in the exuberance of her delight ordering the clouds away from off her face the prince could hardly believe she was not a creature of the elements after all  by the time she had completed another circle the clouds had gathered deep and there were growlings of distant thunder just as she passed the tree where he stood a flash of lightning blinded him for a moment and when he saw again to his horror the princess lay on the ground he darted to her thinking she had been struck but when she heard him coming she was on her feet in a moment  what do you want she asked  i beg your pardon i thought the lightning said the prince hesitating  there's nothing the matter said the princess waving him off rather haughtily  the poor prince turned and walked towards the wood  come back said daylight  i like you you do what you are told are you good  not so good as i should like to be said the prince  then go and grow better said the princess  again the disappointed prince turned and went  come back said the princess  he obeyed and stood before her waiting  can you tell me what the sun is like she asked  no he answered but where's the good of asking what you know  but i don't know she rejoined  why everybody knows  that's the very thing  i'm not everybody i've never seen the sun  then you can't know what it's like till you do see it  i think you must be a prince said the princess  do i look like one said the prince  i can't quite say that  then why do you think so  because you both do what you are told and speak the truth is the sun so very bright  as bright as the lightning  but it doesn't go out like that does it  oh no it shines like the moon rises and sets like the moon is much the same shape as the moon only so bright that you can't look at it for a moment  but i would look at it said the princess  but you couldn't said the prince  but i could said the princess  why don't you then  because i can't  why can't you  because i can't wake and i never shall wake until    here she hid her face in her hands turned away and walked in the slowest stateliest manner towards the house the prince ventured to follow her at a little distance but she turned and made a repellent gesture which like a true gentleman-prince he obeyed at once he waited a long time but as she did not come near him again and as the night had now cleared he set off at last for the old woman's cottage  it was long past midnight when he reached it but to his surprise the old woman was paring potatoes at the door fairies are fond of doing odd things indeed however they may dissemble the night is always their day and so it is with all who have fairy blood in them  why what are you doing there this time of the night mother said the prince for that was the kind way in which any young man in his country would address a woman who was much older than himself  getting your supper ready my son she answered  oh i don't want any supper said the prince  ah you've seen daylight said she  i've seen a princess who never saw it said the prince  do you like her asked the fairy  oh don't i said the prince more than you would believe mother  a fairy can believe anything that ever was or ever could be said the old woman  then are you a fairy asked the prince  yes said she  then what do you do for things not to believe asked the prince  there's plenty of them everything that never was nor ever could be  plenty i grant you said the prince but do you believe there could be a princess who never saw the daylight do you believe that now  this the prince said not that he doubted the princess but that he wanted the fairy to tell him more she was too old a fairy however to be caught so easily  of all people fairies must not tell secrets besides she's a princess  well i'll tell you a secret i'm a prince  i know that  how do you know it  by the curl of the third eyelash on your left eyelid  which corner do you count from  that's a secret  another secret well at least if i am a prince there can be no harm in telling me about a princess  it's just the princes i can't tell  there ain't any more of them are there said the prince  what you don't think you're the only prince in the world do you  oh dear no not at all but i know there's one too many just at present except the princess    yes yes that's it said the fairy  what's it asked the prince  but he could get nothing more out of the fairy and had to go to bed unanswered which was something of a trial  now wicked fairies will not be bound by the law which the good fairies obey and this always seems to give the bad the advantage over the good for they use means to gain their ends which the others will not but it is all of no consequence for what they do never succeeds nay in the end it brings about the very thing they are trying to prevent so you see that somehow for all their cleverness wicked fairies are dreadfully stupid for although from the beginning of the world they have really helped instead of thwarting the good fairies not one of them is a bit wiser for it she will try the bad thing just as they all did before her and succeeds no better of course  the prince had so far stolen a march upon the swamp-fairy that she did not know he was in the neighbourhood until after he had seen the princess those three times when she knew it she consoled herself by thinking that the princess must be far too proud and too modest for any young man to venture even to speak to her before he had seen her six times at least but there was even less danger than the wicked fairy thought for however much the princess might desire to be set free she was dreadfully afraid of the wrong prince now however the fairy was going to do all she could  she so contrived it by her deceitful spells that the next night the prince could not by any endeavour find his way to the glade it would take me too long to tell her tricks they would be amusing to us who know that they could not do any harm but they were something other than amusing to the poor prince he wandered about the forest till daylight and then fell fast asleep the same thing occurred for seven following days during which neither could he find the good fairy's cottage after the third quarter of the moon however the bad fairy thought she might be at ease about the affair for a fortnight at least for there was no chance of the prince wishing to kiss the princess during that period so the first day of the fourth quarter he did find the cottage and the next day he found the glade for nearly another week he haunted it but the princess never came i have little doubt she was on the farther edge of it some part of every night but at this period she always wore black and there being little or no light the prince never saw her nor would he have known her if he had seen her how could he have taken the worn decrepit creature she was now for the glorious princess daylight  at last one night when there was no moon at all he ventured near the house there he heard voices talking although it was past midnight for her women were in considerable uneasiness because the one whose turn it was to watch her had fallen asleep and had not seen which way she went and this was a night when she would probably wander very far describing a circle which did not touch the open glade at all but stretched away from the back of the house deep into that side of the forest a part of which the prince knew nothing when he understood from what they said that she had disappeared and that she must have gone somewhere in the said direction he plunged at once into the wood to see if he could find her for hours he roamed with nothing to guide him but the vague notion of a circle which on one side bordered on the house for so much had he picked up from the talk he had overheard  it was getting towards the dawn but as yet there was no streak of light in the sky when he came to a great birch-tree and sat down weary at the foot of it while he sat very miserable you may be sure full of fear for the princess and wondering how her attendants could take it so quietly he bethought himself that it would not be a bad plan to light a fire which if she were anywhere near would attract her this he managed with a tinder-box which the good fairy had given him it was just beginning to blaze up when he heard a moan which seemed to come from the other side of the tree he sprung to his feet but his heart throbbed so that he had to lean for a moment against the tree before he could move when he got round there lay a human form in a little dark heap on the earth there was light enough from his fire to show that it was not the princess he lifted it in his arms hardly heavier than a child and carried it to the flame the countenance was that of an old woman but it had a fearfully strange look a black hood concealed her hair and her eyes were closed he laid her down as comfortably as he could chafed her hands put a little cordial from a bottle also the gift of the fairy into her mouth took off his coat and wrapped it about her and in short did the best he could in a little while she opened her eyes and looked at him so pitifully the tears rose and flowed from her grey wrinkled cheeks but she said never a word she closed her eyes again but the tears kept on flowing and her whole appearance was so utterly pitiful that the prince was near crying too he begged her to tell him what was the matter promising to do all he could to help her but still she did not speak he thought she was dying and took her in his arms again to carry her to the princess's house where he thought the good-natured cook might be able to do something for her when he lifted her the tears flowed yet faster and she gave such a sad moan that it went to his very heart  mother mother he said poor mother and kissed her on the withered lips  she started and what eyes they were that opened upon him but he did not see them for it was still very dark and he had enough to do to make his way through the trees towards the house  just as he approached the door feeling more tired than he could have imagined possible she was such a little thin old thing she began to move and became so restless that unable to carry her a moment longer he thought to lay her on the grass but she stood upright on her feet her hood had dropped and her hair fell about her the first gleam of the morning was caught on her face  that face was bright as the never-aging dawn and her eyes were lovely as the sky of darkest blue the prince recoiled in overmastering wonder it was daylight herself whom he had brought from the forest he fell at her feet nor dared to look up until she laid her hand upon his head he rose then  you kissed me when i was an old woman  there i kiss you when i am a young princess murmured daylight is that the sun coming     chapter xxix ruby   the children were delighted with the story and made many amusing remarks upon it mr raymond promised to search his brain for another and when he had found one to bring it to them diamond having taken leave of nanny and promised to go and see her again soon went away with him  now mr raymond had been turning over in his mind what he could do both for diamond and for nanny he had therefore made some acquaintance with diamond's father and had been greatly pleased with him but he had come to the resolution before he did anything so good as he would like to do for them to put them all to a certain test so as they walked away together he began to talk with diamond as follows    nanny must leave the hospital soon diamond  i'm glad of that sir  why don't you think it's a nice place  yes very but it's better to be well and doing something you know even if it's not quite so comfortable  but they can't keep nanny so long as they would like they can't keep her till she's quite strong there are always so many sick children they want to take in and make better and the question is what will she do when they send her out again  that's just what i can't tell though i've been thinking of it over and over sir her crossing was taken long ago and i couldn't bear to see nanny fighting for it especially with such a poor fellow as has taken it he's quite lame sir  she doesn't look much like fighting now does she diamond  no sir she looks too like an angel angels don't fight do they sir  not to get things for themselves at least said mr raymond  besides added diamond i don't quite see that she would have any better right to the crossing than the boy who has got it nobody gave it to her she only took it and now he has taken it  if she were to sweep a crossing soon at least after the illness she has had she would be laid up again the very first wet day said mr raymond  and there's hardly any money to be got except on the wet days  remarked diamond reflectively is there nothing else she could do sir  not without being taught i'm afraid  well couldn't somebody teach her something  couldn't you teach her diamond  i don't know anything myself sir i could teach her to dress the baby but nobody would give her anything for doing things like that  they are so easy there wouldn't be much good in teaching her to drive a cab for where would she get the cab to drive there ain't fathers and old diamonds everywhere at least poor nanny can't find any of them i doubt  perhaps if she were taught to be nice and clean and only speak gentle words  mother could teach her that interrupted diamond  and to dress babies and feed them and take care of them mr raymond proceeded she might get a place as a nurse somewhere you know people do give money for that  then i'll ask mother said diamond  but you'll have to give her her food then and your father not being strong has enough to do already without that  but here's me said diamond  i help him out with it when he's tired of driving up i get it don't make any difference to old diamond i don't mean he likes me as well as my father of course he can't you know nobody could but he does his duty all the same it's got to be done you know sir and diamond's a good horse isn't he sir  from your description i should say certainly but i have not the pleasure of his acquaintance myself  don't you think he will go to heaven sir  that i don't know anything about said mr raymond i confess i should be glad to think so he added smiling thoughtfully  i'm sure he'll get to the back of the north wind anyhow said diamond to himself but he had learned to be very careful of saying such things aloud  isn't it rather too much for him to go in the cab all day and every day resumed mr raymond  so father says when he feels his ribs of a morning but then he says the old horse do eat well and the moment he's had his supper down he goes and never gets up till he's called and for the legs of him father says that makes no end of a differ some horses sir they won't lie down all night long but go to sleep on their four pins like a haystack father says i think it's very stupid of them and so does old diamond but then i suppose they don't know better and so they can't help it we mustn't be too hard upon them father says  your father must be a good man diamond diamond looked up in mr raymond's face wondering what he could mean  i said your father must be a good man diamond  of course said diamond how could he drive a cab if he wasn't  there are some men who drive cabs who are not very good objected mr raymond  diamond remembered the drunken cabman and saw that his friend was right  ah but he returned he must be you know with such a horse as old diamond  that does make a difference said mr raymond but it is quite enough that he is a good man without our trying to account for it now if you like i will give you a proof that i think him a good man i am going away on the continent for a while for three months i believe and i am going to let my house to a gentleman who does not want the use of my brougham my horse is nearly as old i fancy as your diamond but i don't want to part with him and i don't want him to be idle for nobody as you say ought to be idle but neither do i want him to be worked very hard now it has come into my head that perhaps your father would take charge of him and work him under certain conditions  my father will do what's right said diamond i'm sure of that  well so i think will you ask him when he comes home to call and have a little chat with me to-day some time  he must have his dinner first said diamond no he's got his dinner with him to-day it must be after he's had his tea  of course of course any time will do i shall be at home all day  very well sir i will tell him you may be sure he will come my father thinks you a very kind gentleman and i know he is right for i know your very own self sir  mr raymond smiled and as they had now reached his door they parted and diamond went home as soon as his father entered the house diamond gave him mr raymond's message and recounted the conversation that had preceded it his father said little but took thought-sauce to his bread and butter and as soon as he had finished his meal rose saying   i will go to your friend directly diamond it would be a grand thing to get a little more money we do want it diamond accompanied his father to mr raymond's door and there left him  he was shown at once into mr raymond's study where he gazed with some wonder at the multitude of books on the walls and thought what a learned man mr raymond must be  presently mr raymond entered and after saying much the same about his old horse made the following distinct proposal one not over-advantageous to diamond's father but for which he had reasons namely that joseph should have the use of mr raymond's horse while he was away on condition that he never worked him more than six hours a day and fed him well and that besides he should take nanny home as soon as she was able to leave the hospital and provide for her as one of his own children neither better nor worse so long that is as he had the horse  diamond's father could not help thinking it a pretty close bargain he should have both the girl and the horse to feed and only six hours' work out of the horse  it will save your own horse said mr raymond  that is true answered joseph but all i can get by my own horse is only enough to keep us and if i save him and feed your horse and the girl don't you see sir  well you can go home and think about it and let me know by the end of the week i am in no hurry before then  so joseph went home and recounted the proposal to his wife adding that he did not think there was much advantage to be got out of it  not much that way husband said diamond's mother but there would be an advantage and what matter who gets it  i don't see it answered her husband mr raymond is a gentleman of property and i don't discover any much good in helping him to save a little more he won't easily get one to make such a bargain and i don't mean he shall get me it would be a loss rather than a gain i do think at least if i took less work out of our own horse  one hour would make a difference to old diamond but that's not the main point you must think what an advantage it would be to the poor girl that hasn't a home to go to  she is one of diamond's friends thought his father  i could be kind to her you know the mother went on and teach her housework and how to handle a baby and besides she would help me and i should be the stronger for it and able to do an odd bit of charing now and then when i got the chance  i won't hear of that said her husband have the girl by all means i'm ashamed i did not think of both sides of the thing at once i wonder if the horse is a great eater to be sure if i gave diamond two hours' additional rest it would be all the better for the old bones of him and there would be four hours extra out of the other horse that would give diamond something to do every day he could drive old diamond after dinner and i could take the other horse out for six hours after tea or in the morning as i found best it might pay for the keep of both of them that is if i had good luck i should like to oblige mr raymond though he be rather hard for he has been very kind to our diamond wife hasn't he now  he has indeed joseph said his wife and there the conversation ended  diamond's father went the very next day to mr raymond and accepted his proposal so that the week after having got another stall in the same stable he had two horses instead of one oddly enough the name of the new horse was ruby for he was a very red chestnut diamond's name came from a white lozenge on his forehead young diamond said they were rich now with such a big diamond and such a big ruby     chapter xxx nanny's dream   nanny was not fit to be moved for some time yet and diamond went to see her as often as he could but being more regularly engaged now seeing he went out every day for a few hours with old diamond and had his baby to mind and one of the horses to attend to he could not go so often as he would have liked  one evening as he sat by her bedside she said to him   i've had such a beautiful dream diamond i should like to tell it you  oh do said diamond i am so fond of dreams  she must have been to the back of the north wind he said to himself  it was a very foolish dream you know but somehow it was so pleasant what a good thing it is that you believe the dream all the time you are in it  my readers must not suppose that poor nanny was able to say what she meant so well as i put it down here she had never been to school and had heard very little else than vulgar speech until she came to the hospital but i have been to school and although that could never make me able to dream so well as nanny it has made me able to tell her dream better than she could herself and i am the more desirous of doing this for her that i have already done the best i could for diamond's dream and it would be a shame to give the boy all the advantage  i will tell you all i know about it said nanny the day before yesterday a lady came to see us a very beautiful lady and very beautifully dressed i heard the matron say to her that it was very kind of her to come in blue and gold and she answered that she knew we didn't like dull colours she had such a lovely shawl on just like redness dipped in milk and all worked over with flowers of the same colour it didn't shine much it was silk but it kept in the shine when she came to my bedside she sat down just where you are sitting diamond and laid her hand on the counterpane i was sitting up with my table before me ready for my tea her hand looked so pretty in its blue glove that i was tempted to stroke it i thought she wouldn't be angry for everybody that comes to the hospital is kind it's only in the streets they ain't kind but she drew her hand away and i almost cried for i thought i had been rude instead of that however it was only that she didn't like giving me her glove to stroke for she drew it off and then laid her hand where it was before i wasn't sure but i ventured to put out my ugly hand  your hand ain't ugly nanny said diamond but nanny went on   and i stroked it again and then she stroked mine think of that and there was a ring on her finger and i looked down to see what it was like and she drew it off and put it upon one of my fingers it was a red stone and she told me they called it a ruby  oh that is funny said diamond our new horse is called ruby we've got another horse a red one such a beauty  but nanny went on with her story  i looked at the ruby all the time the lady was talking to me it was so beautiful and as she talked i kept seeing deeper and deeper into the stone at last she rose to go away and i began to pull the ring off my finger and what do you think she said 'wear it all night if you like only you must take care of it i can't give it you for some one gave it to me but you may keep it till to-morrow' wasn't it kind of her i could hardly take my tea i was so delighted to hear it and i do think it was the ring that set me dreaming for after i had taken my tea i leaned back half lying and half sitting and looked at the ring on my finger by degrees i began to dream the ring grew larger and larger until at last i found that i was not looking at a red stone but at a red sunset which shone in at the end of a long street near where grannie lives i was dressed in rags as i used to be and i had great holes in my shoes at which the nasty mud came through to my feet i didn't use to mind it before but now i thought it horrid and there was the great red sunset with streaks of green and gold between standing looking at me why couldn't i live in the sunset instead of in that dirt why was it so far away always why did it never come into our wretched street it faded away as the sunsets always do and at last went out altogether then a cold wind began to blow and flutter all my rags about    that was north wind herself said diamond  eh said nanny and went on with her story  i turned my back to it and wandered away i did not know where i was going only it was warmer to go that way i don't think it was a north wind for i found myself in the west end at last but it doesn't matter in a dream which wind it was  i don't know that said diamond i believe north wind can get into our dreams yes and blow in them sometimes she has blown me out of a dream altogether  i don't know what you mean diamond said nanny  never mind answered diamond two people can't always understand each other they'd both be at the back of the north wind directly and what would become of the other places without them  you do talk so oddly said nanny i sometimes think they must have been right about you  what did they say about me asked diamond  they called you god's baby  how kind of them but i knew that  did you know what it meant though it meant that you were not right in the head  i feel all right said diamond putting both hands to his head as if it had been a globe he could take off and set on again  well as long as you are pleased i am pleased said nanny  thank you nanny do go on with your story i think i like dreams even better than fairy tales but they must be nice ones like yours you know  well i went on keeping my back to the wind until i came to a fine street on the top of a hill how it happened i don't know but the front door of one of the houses was open and not only the front door but the back door as well so that i could see right through the house and what do you think i saw a garden place with green grass and the moon shining upon it think of that there was no moon in the street but through the house there was the moon i looked and there was nobody near  i would not do any harm and the grass was so much nicer than the mud but i couldn't think of going on the grass with such dirty shoes  i kicked them off in the gutter and ran in on my bare feet up the steps and through the house and on to the grass and the moment i came into the moonlight i began to feel better  that's why north wind blew you there said diamond  it came of mr raymond's story about princess daylight returned nanny well i lay down upon the grass in the moonlight without thinking how i was to get out again somehow the moon suited me exactly there was not a breath of the north wind you talk about it was quite gone  you didn't want her any more just then she never goes where she's not wanted said diamond but she blew you into the moonlight anyhow  well we won't dispute about it said nanny  you've got a tile loose you know  suppose i have returned diamond don't you see it may let in the moonlight or the sunlight for that matter  perhaps yes perhaps no said nanny  and you've got your dreams too nanny  yes but i know they're dreams  so do i but i know besides they are something more as well  oh do you rejoined nanny i don't  all right said diamond perhaps you will some day  perhaps i won't said nanny  diamond held his peace and nanny resumed her story  i lay a long time and the moonlight got in at every tear in my clothes and made me feel so happy    there i tell you said diamond  what do you tell me returned nanny  north wind    it was the moonlight i tell you persisted nanny and again diamond held his peace  all at once i felt that the moon was not shining so strong i looked up and there was a cloud all crapey and fluffy trying to drown the beautiful creature but the moon was so round just like a whole plate that the cloud couldn't stick to her she shook it off and said there and shone out clearer and brighter than ever but up came a thicker cloud and 'you shan't' said the moon and 'i will' said the cloud but it couldn't  out shone the moon quite laughing at its impudence i knew her ways for i've always been used to watch her she's the only thing worth looking at in our street at night  don't call it your street said diamond you're not going back to it you're coming to us you know  that's too good to be true said nanny  there are very few things good enough to be true said diamond but i hope this is too good to be true it can't be isn't true good and isn't good good and how then can anything be too good to be true that's like old sal to say that  don't abuse grannie diamond she's a horrid old thing she and her gin bottle but she'll repent some day and then you'll be glad not to have said anything against her  why said diamond  because you'll be sorry for her  i am sorry for her now  very well that's right she'll be sorry too and there'll be an end of it  all right you come to us said diamond  where was i said nanny  telling me how the moon served the clouds  yes but it wouldn't do all of it up came the clouds and the clouds and they came faster and faster until the moon was covered up you couldn't expect her to throw off a hundred of them at once could you  certainly not said diamond  so it grew very dark and a dog began to yelp in the house i looked and saw that the door to the garden was shut presently it was opened not to let me out but to let the dog in yelping and bounding i thought if he caught sight of me i was in for a biting first and the police after so i jumped up and ran for a little summer-house in the corner of the garden the dog came after me but i shut the door in his face it was well it had a door wasn't it  you dreamed of the door because you wanted it said diamond  no i didn't it came of itself it was there in the true dream  there i've caught you said diamond i knew you believed in the dream as much as i do  oh well if you will lay traps for a body said nanny anyhow i was safe inside the summer-house and what do you think there was the moon beginning to shine again but only through one of the panes and that one was just the colour of the ruby wasn't it funny  no not a bit funny said diamond  if you will be contrary said nanny  no no said diamond i only meant that was the very pane i should have expected her to shine through  oh very well returned nanny  what diamond meant i do not pretend to say he had curious notions about things  and now said nanny i didn't know what to do for the dog kept barking at the door and i couldn't get out but the moon was so beautiful that i couldn't keep from looking at it through the red pane and as i looked it got larger and larger till it filled the whole pane and outgrew it so that i could see it through the other panes and it grew till it filled them too and the whole window so that the summer-house was nearly as bright as day  the dog stopped barking and i heard a gentle tapping at the door like the wind blowing a little branch against it  just like her said diamond who thought everything strange and beautiful must be done by north wind  so i turned from the window and opened the door and what do you think i saw  a beautiful lady said diamond  no the moon itself as big as a little house and as round as a ball shining like yellow silver it stood on the grass down on the very grass  i could see nothing else for the brightness of it  and as i stared and wondered a door opened in the side of it near the ground and a curious little old man with a crooked thing over his shoulder looked out and said  'come along nanny my lady wants you we're come to fetch you i wasn't a bit frightened i went up to the beautiful bright thing and the old man held down his hand and i took hold of it and gave a jump and he gave me a lift and i was inside the moon and what do you think it was like it was such a pretty little house with blue windows and white curtains at one of the windows sat a beautiful lady with her head leaning on her hand looking out she seemed rather sad and i was sorry for her and stood staring at her  `you didn't think i had such a beautiful mistress as that' said the queer little man `no indeed' i answered  `who would have thought it' `ah who indeed but you see you don't know everything' the little man closed the door and began to pull at a rope which hung behind it with a weight at the end after he had pulled a while he said `there that will do we're all right now' then he took me by the hand and opened a little trap in the floor and led me down two or three steps and i saw like a great hole below me `don't be frightened' said the tittle man `it's not a hole it's only a window put your face down and look through' i did as he told me and there was the garden and the summer-house far away lying at the bottom of the moonlight `there' said the little man `we've brought you off do you see the little dog barking at us down there in the garden' i told him i couldn't see anything so far `can you see anything so small and so far off' i said `bless you child' said the little man `i could pick up a needle out of the grass if i had only a long enough arm there's one lying by the door of the summer-house now' i looked at his eyes they were very small but so bright that i think he saw by the light that went out of them then he took me up and up again by a little stair in a corner of the room and through another trapdoor and there was one great round window above us and i saw the blue sky and the clouds and such lots of stars all so big and shining as hard as ever they could  the little girl-angels had been polishing them said diamond  what nonsense you do talk said nanny  but my nonsense is just as good as yours nanny when you have done i'll tell you my dream the stars are in it not the moon though she was away somewhere perhaps she was gone to fetch you then i don't think that though for my dream was longer ago than yours she might have been to fetch some one else though for we can't fancy it's only us that get such fine things done for them but do tell me what came next  perhaps one of my child-readers may remember whether the moon came down to fetch him or her the same night that diamond had his dream i cannot tell of course i know she did not come to fetch me though i did think i could make her follow me when i was a boy not a very tiny one either  the little man took me all round the house and made me look out of every window oh it was beautiful there we were all up in the air in such a nice clean little house `your work will be to keep the windows bright' said the little man `you won't find it very difficult for there ain't much dust up here only the frost settles on them sometimes and the drops of rain leave marks on them' `i can easily clean them inside' i said `but how am i to get the frost and rain off the outside of them' `oh' he said `it's quite easy there are ladders all about you've only got to go out at the door and climb about there are a great many windows you haven't seen yet and some of them look into places you don't know anything about i used to clean them myself but i'm getting rather old you see ain't i now' `i can't tell' i answered `you see i never saw you when you were younger' `never saw the man in the moon' said he `not very near' i answered `not to tell how young or how old he looked i have seen the bundle of sticks on his back' for jim had pointed that out to me jim was very fond of looking at the man in the moon poor jim i wonder he hasn't been to see me i'm afraid he's ill too  i'll try to find out said diamond and let you know  thank you said nanny you and jim ought to be friends  but what did the man in the moon say when you told him you had seen him with the bundle of sticks on his back  he laughed but i thought he looked offended too his little nose turned up sharper and he drew the corners of his mouth down from the tips of his ears into his neck but he didn't look cross you know  didn't he say anything  oh yes he said  `that's all nonsense what you saw was my bundle of dusters i was going to clean the windows it takes a good many you know really what they do say of their superiors down there' `it's only because they don't know better' i ventured to say `of course of course' said the little man `nobody ever does know better well i forgive them and that sets it all right i hope' `it's very good of you' i said `no' said he `it's not in the least good of me i couldn't be comfortable otherwise' after this he said nothing for a while and i laid myself on the floor of his garret and stared up and around at the great blue beautifulness i had forgotten him almost when at last he said  `ain't you done yet' `done what' i asked `done saying your prayers' says he 'i wasn't saying my prayers' i answered `oh yes you were' said he `though you didn't know it and now i must show you something else'  he took my hand and led me down the stair again and through a narrow passage and through another and another and another i don't know how there could be room for so many passages in such a little house the heart of it must be ever so much farther from the sides than they are from each other how could it have an inside that was so independent of its outside there's the point it was funny wasn't it diamond  no said diamond he was going to say that that was very much the sort of thing at the back of the north wind but he checked himself and only added all right i don't see it i don't see why the inside should depend on the outside it ain't so with the crabs they creep out of their outsides and make new ones mr raymond told me so  i don't see what that has got to do with it said nanny  then go on with your story please said diamond what did you come to after going through all those winding passages into the heart of the moon  i didn't say they were winding passages i said they were long and narrow they didn't wind they went by corners  that's worth knowing remarked diamond for who knows how soon he may have to go there but the main thing is what did you come to at last  we came to a small box against the wall of a tiny room the little man told me to put my ear against it i did so and heard a noise something like the purring of a cat only not so loud and much sweeter `what is it' i asked `don't you know the sound' returned the little man `no' i answered `don't you know the sound of bees' he said i had never heard bees and could not know the sound of them `those are my lady's bees' he went on i had heard that bees gather honey from the flowers `but where are the flowers for them' i asked `my lady's bees gather their honey from the sun and the stars' said the little man `do let me see them' i said `no i daren't do that' he answered `i have no business with them i don't understand them besides they are so bright that if one were to fly into your eye it would blind you altogether' `then you have seen them' `oh yes once or twice i think but i don't quite know  they are so very bright like buttons of lightning now i've showed you all i can to-night and we'll go back to the room' i followed him and he made me sit down under a lamp that hung from the roof and gave me some bread and honey  the lady had never moved she sat with her forehead leaning on her hand gazing out of the little window hung like the rest with white cloudy curtains from where i was sitting i looked out of it too but i could see nothing her face was very beautiful and very white and very still and her hand was as white as the forehead that leaned on it i did not see her whole face only the side of it for she never moved to turn it full upon me or even to look at me  how long i sat after i had eaten my bread and honey i don't know the little man was busy about the room pulling a string here and a string there but chiefly the string at the back of the door i was thinking with some uneasiness that he would soon be wanting me to go out and clean the windows and i didn't fancy the job at last he came up to me with a great armful of dusters `it's time you set about the windows' he said `for there's rain coming and if they're quite clean before then the rain can't spoil them' i got up at once `you needn't be afraid' he said `you won't tumble off only you must be careful always hold on with one hand while you rub with the other' as he spoke he opened the door i started back in a terrible fright for there was nothing but blue air to be seen under me like a great water without a bottom at all but what must be must and to live up here was so much nicer than down in the mud with holes in my shoes that i never thought of not doing as i was told the little man showed me how and where to lay hold while i put my foot round the edge of the door on to the first round of a ladder `once you're up' he said `you'll see how you have to go well enough' i did as he told me and crept out very carefully then the little man handed me the bundle of dusters saying `i always carry them on my reaping hook but i don't think you could manage it properly you shall have it if you like' i wouldn't take it however for it looked dangerous  i did the best i could with the dusters and crawled up to the top of the moon but what a grand sight it was the stars were all over my head so bright and so near that i could almost have laid hold of them the round ball to which i clung went bobbing and floating away through the dark blue above and below and on every side it was so beautiful that all fear left me and i set to work diligently i cleaned window after window at length i came to a very little one in at which i peeped there was the room with the box of bees in it i laid my ear to the window and heard the musical hum quite distinctly a great longing to see them came upon me and i opened the window and crept in the little box had a door like a closet i opened it the tiniest crack when out came the light with such a sting that i closed it again in terror not however before three bees had shot out into the room where they darted about like flashes of lightning terribly frightened i tried to get out of the window again but i could not  there was no way to the outside of the moon but through the door and that was in the room where the lady sat no sooner had i reached the room than the three bees which had followed me flew at once to the lady and settled upon her hair then first i saw her move she started put up her hand and caught them then rose and having held them into the flame of the lamp one after the other turned to me her face was not so sad now as stern it frightened me much `nanny you have got me into trouble' she said `you have been letting out my bees which it is all i can do to manage you have forced me to burn them it is a great loss and there will be a storm' as she spoke the clouds had gathered all about us i could see them come crowding up white about the windows `i am sorry to find' said the lady `that you are not to be trusted you must go home again you won't do for us' then came a great clap of thunder and the moon rocked and swayed all grew dark about me and i fell on the floor and lay half-stunned i could hear everything but could see nothing `shall i throw her out of the door my lady' said the little man `no' she answered `she's not quite bad enough for that i don't think there's much harm in her only she'll never do for us she would make dreadful mischief up here she's only fit for the mud it's a great pity i am sorry for her just take that ring off her finger i am sadly afraid she has stolen it' the little man caught hold of my hand and i felt him tugging at the ring i tried to speak what was true about it but after a terrible effort only gave a groan other things began to come into my head somebody else had a hold of me the little man wasn't there i opened my eyes at last and saw the nurse i had cried out in my sleep and she had come and waked me but diamond for all it was only a dream i cannot help being ashamed of myself yet for opening the lady's box of bees  you wouldn't do it again would you if she were to take you back  said diamond  no i don't think anything would ever make me do it again but where's the good i shall never have the chance  i don't know that said diamond  you silly baby it was only a dream said nanny  i know that nanny dear but how can you tell you mayn't dream it again  that's not a bit likely  i don't know that said diamond  you're always saying that said nanny i don't like it  then i won't say it again if i don't forget said diamond but it was such a beautiful dream wasn't it nanny what a pity you opened that door and let the bees out you might have had such a long dream and such nice talks with the moon-lady do try to go again nanny i do so want to hear more  but now the nurse came and told him it was time to go and diamond went saying to himself i can't help thinking that north wind had something to do with that dream it would be tiresome to lie there all day and all night too without dreaming perhaps if she hadn't done that the moon might have carried her to the back of the north wind who knows     chapter xxxi the north wind doth blow   it was a great delight to diamond when at length nanny was well enough to leave the hospital and go home to their house she was not very strong yet but diamond's mother was very considerate of her and took care that she should have nothing to do she was not quite fit for if nanny had been taken straight from the street it is very probable she would not have been so pleasant in a decent household or so easy to teach but after the refining influences of her illness and the kind treatment she had had in the hospital she moved about the house just like some rather sad pleasure haunting the mind as she got better and the colour came back to her cheeks her step grew lighter and quicker her smile shone out more readily and it became certain that she would soon be a treasure of help it was great fun to see diamond teaching her how to hold the baby and wash and dress him and often they laughed together over her awkwardness but she had not many such lessons before she was able to perform those duties quite as well as diamond himself  things however did not go well with joseph from the very arrival of ruby it almost seemed as if the red beast had brought ill luck with him the fares were fewer and the pay less ruby's services did indeed make the week's income at first a little beyond what it used to be but then there were two more to feed after the first month he fell lame and for the whole of the next joseph dared not attempt to work him i cannot say that he never grumbled for his own health was far from what it had been but i can say that he tried to do his best during all that month they lived on very short commons indeed seldom tasting meat except on sundays and poor old diamond who worked hardest of all not even then so that at the end of it he was as thin as a clothes-horse while ruby was as plump and sleek as a bishop's cob  nor was it much better after ruby was able to work again for it was a season of great depression in business and that is very soon felt amongst the cabmen city men look more after their shillings and their wives and daughters have less to spend it was besides a wet autumn and bread rose greatly in price when i add to this that diamond's mother was but poorly for a new baby was coming you will see that these were not very jolly times for our friends in the mews  notwithstanding the depressing influences around him joseph was able to keep a little hope alive in his heart and when he came home at night would get diamond to read to him and would also make nanny produce her book that he might see how she was getting on for diamond had taken her education in hand and as she was a clever child she was very soon able to put letters and words together  thus the three months passed away but mr raymond did not return joseph had been looking anxiously for him chiefly with the desire of getting rid of ruby not that he was absolutely of no use to him but that he was a constant weight upon his mind indeed as far as provision went he was rather worse off with ruby and nanny than he had been before but on the other hand nanny was a great help in the house and it was a comfort to him to think that when the new baby did come nanny would be with his wife  of god's gifts a baby is of the greatest therefore it is no wonder that when this one came she was as heartily welcomed by the little household as if she had brought plenty with her of course she made a great difference in the work to be done far more difference than her size warranted but nanny was no end of help and diamond was as much of a sunbeam as ever and began to sing to the new baby the first moment he got her in his arms but he did not sing the same songs to her that he had sung to his brother for he said she was a new baby and must have new songs and besides she was a sister-baby and not a brother-baby and of course would not like the same kind of songs where the difference in his songs lay however i do not pretend to be able to point out one thing i am sure of that they not only had no small share in the education of the little girl but helped the whole family a great deal more than they were aware  how they managed to get through the long dreary expensive winter i can hardly say sometimes things were better sometimes worse but at last the spring came and the winter was over and gone and that was much still mr raymond did not return and although the mother would have been able to manage without nanny now they could not look for a place for her so long as they had ruby and they were not altogether sorry for this one week at last was worse than they had yet had they were almost without bread before it was over but the sadder he saw his father and mother looking the more diamond set himself to sing to the two babies  one thing which had increased their expenses was that they had been forced to hire another little room for nanny when the second baby came diamond gave up his room that nanny might be at hand to help his mother and went to hers which although a fine place to what she had been accustomed to was not very nice in his eyes he did not mind the change though for was not his mother the more comfortable for it and was not nanny more comfortable too and indeed was not diamond himself more comfortable that other people were more comfortable and if there was more comfort every way the change was a happy one     chapter xxxii diamond and ruby   it was friday night and diamond like the rest of the household had had very little to eat that day the mother would always pay the week's rent before she laid out anything even on food his father had been very gloomy so gloomy that he had actually been cross to his wife it is a strange thing how pain of seeing the suffering of those we love will sometimes make us add to their suffering by being cross with them this comes of not having faith enough in god and shows how necessary this faith is for when we lose it we lose even the kindness which alone can soothe the suffering diamond in consequence had gone to bed very quiet and thoughtful a little troubled indeed  it had been a very stormy winter and even now that the spring had come the north wind often blew when diamond went to his bed which was in a tiny room in the roof he heard it like the sea moaning and when he fell asleep he still heard the moaning all at once he said to himself am i awake or am i asleep but he had no time to answer the question for there was north wind calling him his heart beat very fast it was such a long time since he had heard that voice he jumped out of bed and looked everywhere but could not see her diamond come here she said again and again but where the here was he could not tell to be sure the room was all but quite dark and she might be close beside him  dear north wind said diamond i want so much to go to you but i can't tell where  come here diamond was all her answer  diamond opened the door and went out of the room and down the stair and into the yard his little heart was in a flutter for he had long given up all thought of seeing her again neither now was he to see her when he got out a great puff of wind came against him and in obedience to it he turned his back and went as it blew it blew him right up to the stable-door and went on blowing  she wants me to go into the stable said diamond to himself but the door is locked  he knew where the key was in a certain hole in the wall far too high for him to get at he ran to the place however  just as he reached it there came a wild blast and down fell the key clanging on the stones at his feet he picked it up and ran back and opened the stable-door and went in and what do you think he saw  a little light came through the dusty window from a gas-lamp sufficient to show him diamond and ruby with their two heads up looking at each other across the partition of their stalls the light showed the white mark on diamond's forehead but ruby's eye shone so bright that he thought more light came out of it than went in this is what he saw  but what do you think he heard  he heard the two horses talking to each other in a strange language which yet somehow or other he could understand and turn over in his mind in english the first words he heard were from diamond who apparently had been already quarrelling with ruby  look how fat you are ruby said old diamond you are so plump and your skin shines so you ought to be ashamed of yourself  there's no harm in being fat said ruby in a deprecating tone no nor in being sleek i may as well shine as not  no harm retorted diamond is it no harm to go eating up all poor master's oats and taking up so much of his time grooming you when you only work six hours no not six hours a day and as i hear get along no faster than a big dray-horse with two tons behind him so they tell me  your master's not mine said ruby i must attend to my own master's interests and eat all that is given me and be sleek and fat as i can and go no faster than i need  now really if the rest of the horses weren't all asleep poor things they work till they're tired i do believe they would get up and kick you out of the stable you make me ashamed of being a horse you dare to say my master ain't your master that's your gratitude for the way he feeds you and spares you pray where would your carcass be if it weren't for him  he doesn't do it for my sake if i were his own horse he would work me as hard as he does you  and i'm proud to be so worked i wouldn't be as fat as you not for all you're worth you're a disgrace to the stable look at the horse next you he's something like a horse all skin and bone and his master ain't over kind to him either he put a stinging lash on his whip last week but that old horse knows he's got the wife and children to keep as well as his drunken master and he works like a horse i daresay he grudges his master the beer he drinks but i don't believe he grudges anything else  well i don't grudge yours what he gets by me said ruby  gets retorted diamond what he gets isn't worth grudging it comes to next to nothing what with your fat and shine  well at least you ought to be thankful you're the better for it you get a two hours' rest a day out of it  i thank my master for that not you you lazy fellow you go along like a buttock of beef upon castors you do  ain't you afraid i'll kick if you go on like that diamond  kick you couldn't kick if you tried you might heave your rump up half a foot but for lashing out oho if you did you'd be down on your belly before you could get your legs under you again it's my belief once out they'd stick out for ever talk of kicking why don't you put one foot before the other now and then when you're in the cab the abuse master gets for your sake is quite shameful no decent horse would bring it on him depend upon it ruby no cabman likes to be abused any more than his fare but his fares at least when you are between the shafts are very much to be excused indeed they are  well you see diamond i don't want to go lame again  i don't believe you were so very lame after all there  oh but i was  then i believe it was all your own fault i'm not lame i never was lame in all my life you don't take care of your legs you never lay them down at night there you are with your huge carcass crushing down your poor legs all night long you don't even care for your own legs so long as you can eat eat and sleep sleep you a horse indeed  but i tell you i was lame  i'm not denying there was a puffy look about your off-pastern but my belief is it wasn't even grease it was fat  i tell you i put my foot on one of those horrid stones they make the roads with and it gave my ankle such a twist  ankle indeed why should you ape your betters horses ain't got any ankles  they're only pasterns and so long as you don't lift your feet better but fall asleep between every step you'll run a good chance of laming all your ankles as you call them one after another it's not your lively horse that comes to grief in that way i tell you i believe it wasn't much and if it was it was your own fault there i've done i'm going to sleep i'll try to think as well of you as i can if you would but step out a bit and run off a little of your fat here diamond began to double up his knees but ruby spoke again and as young diamond thought in a rather different tone  i say diamond i can't bear to have an honest old horse like you think of me like that i will tell you the truth  it was my own fault that i fell lame  i told you so returned the other tumbling against the partition as he rolled over on his side to give his legs every possible privilege in their narrow circumstances  i meant to do it diamond  at the words the old horse arose with a scramble like thunder shot his angry head and glaring eye over into ruby's stall and said   keep out of my way you unworthy wretch or i'll bite you you a horse why did you do that  because i wanted to grow fat  you grease-tub oh my teeth and tail i thought you were a humbug why did you want to get fat there's no truth to be got out of you but by cross-questioning you ain't fit to be a horse  because once i am fat my nature is to keep fat for a long time and i didn't know when master might come home and want to see me  you conceited good-for-nothing brute you're only fit for the knacker's yard you wanted to look handsome did you hold your tongue or i'll break my halter and be at you with your handsome fat  never mind diamond you're a good horse you can't hurt me  can't hurt you just let me once try  no you can't  why then  because i'm an angel  what's that  of course you don't know  indeed i don't  i know you don't an ignorant rude old human horse like you couldn't know it but there's young diamond listening to all we're saying and he knows well enough there are horses in heaven for angels to ride upon as well as other animals lions and eagles and bulls in more important situations the horses the angels ride must be angel-horses else the angels couldn't ride upon them well i'm one of them  you ain't  did you ever know a horse tell a lie  never before but you've confessed to shamming lame  nothing of the sort it was necessary i should grow fat and necessary that good joseph your master should grow lean i could have pretended to be lame but that no horse least of all an angel-horse would do so i must be lame and so i sprained my ankle for the angel-horses have ankles they don't talk horse-slang up there and it hurt me very much i assure you diamond though you mayn't be good enough to be able to believe it  old diamond made no reply he had lain down again and a sleepy snort very like a snore revealed that if he was not already asleep he was past understanding a word that ruby was saying when young diamond found this he thought he might venture to take up the dropt shuttlecock of the conversation  i'm good enough to believe it ruby he said  but ruby never turned his head or took any notice of him i suppose he did not understand more of english than just what the coachman and stableman were in the habit of addressing him with finding however that his companion made no reply he shot his head over the partition and looking down at him said   you just wait till to-morrow and you'll see whether i'm speaking the truth or not i declare the old horse is fast asleep diamond no i won't  ruby turned away and began pulling at his hayrack in silence  diamond gave a shiver and looking round saw that the door of the stable was open he began to feel as if he had been dreaming and after a glance about the stable to see if north wind was anywhere visible he thought he had better go back to bed     chapter xxxiii the prospect brightens   the next morning diamond's mother said to his father i'm not quite comfortable about that child again  which child martha asked joseph you've got a choice now  well diamond i mean i'm afraid he's getting into his queer ways again he's been at his old trick of walking in his sleep i saw him run up the stair in the middle of the night  didn't you go after him wife  of course i did and found him fast asleep in his bed it's because he's had so little meat for the last six weeks i'm afraid  it may be that i'm very sorry but if it don't please god to send us enough what am i to do wife  you can't help it i know my dear good man returned martha and after all i don't know i don't see why he shouldn't get on as well as the rest of us there i'm nursing baby all this time and i get along pretty well i'm sure to hear the little man singing you wouldn't think there was much amiss with him  for at that moment diamond was singing like a lark in the clouds he had the new baby in his arms while his mother was dressing herself joseph was sitting at his breakfast a little weak tea dry bread and very dubious butter which nanny had set for him and which he was enjoying because he was hungry he had groomed both horses and had got old diamond harnessed ready to put to  think of a fat angel dulcimer said diamond  the baby had not been christened yet but diamond in reading his bible had come upon the word dulcimer and thought it so pretty that ever after he called his sister dulcimer  think of a red fat angel dulcimer he repeated for ruby's an angel of a horse dulcimer he sprained his ankle and got fat on purpose  what purpose diamond asked his father  ah that i can't tell i suppose to look handsome when his master comes answered diamond what do you think dulcimer it must be for some good for ruby's an angel  i wish i were rid of him anyhow said his father for he weighs heavy on my mind  no wonder father  he's so fat said diamond but you needn't be afraid for everybody says he's in better condition than when you had him  yes but he may be as thin as a tin horse before his owner comes it was too bad to leave him on my hands this way  perhaps he couldn't help it suggested diamond i daresay he has some good reason for it  so i should have said returned his father if he had not driven such a hard bargain with me at first  but we don't know what may come of it yet husband said his wife mr raymond may give a little to boot seeing you've had more of the bargain than you wanted or reckoned upon  i'm afraid not  he's a hard man said joseph as he rose and went to get his cab out  diamond resumed his singing for some time he carolled snatches of everything or anything but at last it settled down into something like what follows i cannot tell where or how he got it               where did you come from baby dear             out of the everywhere into here              where did you get your eyes so blue             out of the sky as i came through              what makes the light in them sparkle and spin             some of the starry spikes left in              where did you get that little tear             i found it waiting when i got here              what makes your forehead so smooth and high             a soft hand stroked it as i went by              what makes your cheek like a warm white rose             i saw something better than any one knows              whence that three-cornered smile of bliss             three angels gave me at once a kiss              where did you get this pearly ear             god spoke and it came out to hear              where did you get those arms and hands             love made itself into hooks and bands              feet whence did you come you darling things             from the same box as the cherubs' wings              how did they all just come to be you             god thought about me and so i grew              but how did you come to us you dear             god thought about you and so i am here  you never made that song diamond said his mother  no mother i wish i had no i don't that would be to take it from somebody else but it's mine for all that  what makes it yours  i love it so  does loving a thing make it yours  i think so mother at least more than anything else can if i didn't love baby which couldn't be you know she wouldn't be mine a bit but i do love baby and baby is my very own dulcimer  the baby's mine diamond  that makes her the more mine mother  how do you make that out  because you're mine mother  is that because you love me  yes just because love makes the only myness said diamond  when his father came home to have his dinner and change diamond for ruby they saw him look very sad and he told them he had not had a fare worth mentioning the whole morning  we shall all have to go to the workhouse wife he said  it would be better to go to the back of the north wind said diamond dreamily not intending to say it aloud  so it would answered his father but how are we to get there diamond  we must wait till we're taken returned diamond  before his father could speak again a knock came to the door and in walked mr raymond with a smile on his face joseph got up and received him respectfully but not very cordially martha set a chair for him but he would not sit down  you are not very glad to see me he said to joseph you don't want to part with the old horse  indeed sir you are mistaken there what with anxiety about him and bad luck i've wished i were rid of him a thousand times it was only to be for three months and here it's eight or nine  i'm sorry to hear such a statement said mr raymond hasn't he been of service to you  not much not with his lameness  ah said mr raymond hastily you've been laming him have you that accounts for it i see i see  it wasn't my fault and he's all right now i don't know how it happened but   he did it on purpose said diamond he put his foot on a stone just to twist his ankle  how do you know that diamond said his father turning to him i never said so for i could not think how it came  i heard it in the stable answered diamond  let's have a look at him said mr raymond  if you'll step into the yard said joseph i'll bring him out  they went and joseph having first taken off his harness walked ruby into the middle of the yard  why said mr raymond you've not been using him well  i don't know what you mean by that sir i didn't expect to hear that from you he's sound in wind and limb as sound as a barrel  and as big you might add why he's as fat as a pig you don't call that good usage  joseph was too angry to make any answer  you've not worked him enough i say that's not making good use of him that's not doing as you'd be done by  i shouldn't be sorry if i was served the same sir  he's too fat i say  there was a whole month i couldn't work him at all and he did nothing but eat his head off he's an awful eater i've taken the best part of six hours a day out of him since but i'm always afraid of his coming to grief again and so i couldn't make the most even of that i declare to you sir when he's between the shafts i sit on the box as miserable as if i'd stolen him he looks all the time as if he was a bottling up of complaints to make of me the minute he set eyes on you again there look at him now squinting round at me with one eye i declare to you on my word i haven't laid the whip on him more than three times  i'm glad to hear it he never did want the whip  i didn't say that sir if ever a horse wanted the whip he do he's brought me to beggary almost with his snail's pace i'm very glad you've come to rid me of him  i don't know that said mr raymond suppose i were to ask you to buy him of me cheap  i wouldn't have him in a present sir i don't like him and i wouldn't drive a horse that i didn't like no not for gold it can't come to good where there's no love between 'em  just bring out your own horse and let me see what sort of a pair they'd make  joseph laughed rather bitterly as he went to fetch diamond  when the two were placed side by side mr raymond could hardly keep his countenance but from a mingling of feelings beside the great red round barrel ruby all body and no legs diamond looked like a clothes-horse with a skin thrown over it there was hardly a spot of him where you could not descry some sign of a bone underneath gaunt and grim and weary he stood kissing his master and heeding no one else  you haven't been using him well said mr raymond  i must say returned joseph throwing an arm round his horse's neck that the remark had better have been spared sir the horse is worth three of the other now  i don't think so i think they make a very nice pair if the one's too fat the other's too lean so that's all right and if you won't buy my ruby i must buy your diamond  thank you sir said joseph in a tone implying anything but thanks  you don't seem to like the proposal said mr raymond  i don't returned joseph i wouldn't part with my old diamond for his skin as full of nuggets as it is of bones  who said anything about parting with him  you did now sir  no i didn't i only spoke of buying him to make a pair with ruby we could pare ruby and patch diamond a bit and for height they are as near a match as i care about of course you would be the coachman if only you would consent to be reconciled to ruby  joseph stood bewildered unable to answer  i've bought a small place in kent continued mr raymond and i must have a pair to my carriage for the roads are hilly thereabouts i don't want to make a show with a pair of high-steppers i think these will just do suppose for a week or two you set yourself to take ruby down and bring diamond up if we could only lay a pipe from ruby's sides into diamond's it would be the work of a moment but i fear that wouldn't answer  a strong inclination to laugh intruded upon joseph's inclination to cry and made speech still harder than before  i beg your pardon sir he said at length i've been so miserable and for so long that i never thought you was only a chaffing of me when you said i hadn't used the horses well i did grumble at you sir many's the time in my trouble but whenever i said anything my little diamond would look at me with a smile as much as to say  'i know him better than you father' and upon my word i always thought the boy must be right  will you sell me old diamond then  i will sir on one condition that if ever you want to part with him or me you give me the option of buying him i could not part with him sir as to who calls him his that's nothing for as diamond says it's only loving a thing that can make it yours and i do love old diamond sir dearly  well there's a cheque for twenty pounds which i wrote to offer you for him in case i should find you had done the handsome thing by ruby will that be enough  it's too much sir his body ain't worth it shoes and all it's only his heart sir that's worth millions but his heart'll be mine all the same so it's too much sir  i don't think so it won't be at least by the time we've got him fed up again you take it and welcome just go on with your cabbing for another month only take it out of ruby and let diamond rest and by that time i shall be ready for you to go down into the country  thank you sir thank you diamond set you down for a friend sir the moment he saw you i do believe that child of mine knows more than other people  i think so too said mr raymond as he walked away  he had meant to test joseph when he made the bargain about ruby but had no intention of so greatly prolonging the trial he had been taken ill in switzerland and had been quite unable to return sooner he went away now highly gratified at finding that he had stood the test and was a true man  joseph rushed in to his wife who had been standing at the window anxiously waiting the result of the long colloquy when she heard that the horses were to go together in double harness she burst forth into an immoderate fit of laughter diamond came up with the baby in his arms and made big anxious eyes at her saying   what is the matter with you mother dear do cry a little it will do you good when father takes ever so small a drop of spirits he puts water to it  you silly darling said his mother how could i but laugh at the notion of that great fat ruby going side by side with our poor old diamond  but why not mother with a month's oats and nothing to do diamond'll be nearer ruby's size than you will father's i think it's very good for different sorts to go together now ruby will have a chance of teaching diamond better manners  how dare you say such a thing diamond said his father angrily to compare the two for manners there's no comparison possible our diamond's a gentleman  i don't mean to say he isn't father for i daresay some gentlemen judge their neighbours unjustly that's all i mean diamond shouldn't have thought such bad things of ruby he didn't try to make the best of him  how do you know that pray  i heard them talking about it one night  who  why diamond and ruby ruby's an angel  joseph stared and said no more for all his new gladness he was very gloomy as he re-harnessed the angel for he thought his darling diamond was going out of his mind  he could not help thinking rather differently however when he found the change that had come over ruby considering his fat he exerted himself amazingly and got over the ground with incredible speed so willing even anxious was he to go now that joseph had to hold him quite tight  then as he laughed at his own fancies a new fear came upon him lest the horse should break his wind and mr raymond have good cause to think he had not been using him well he might even suppose that he had taken advantage of his new instructions to let out upon the horse some of his pent-up dislike whereas in truth it had so utterly vanished that he felt as if ruby too had been his friend all the time     chapter xxxiv in the country   before the end of the month ruby had got respectably thin and diamond respectably stout they really began to look fit for double harness  joseph and his wife got their affairs in order and everything ready for migrating at the shortest notice and they felt so peaceful and happy that they judged all the trouble they had gone through well worth enduring as for nanny she had been so happy ever since she left the hospital that she expected nothing better and saw nothing attractive in the notion of the country at the same time she had not the least idea of what the word country meant for she had never seen anything about her but streets and gas-lamps besides she was more attached to jim than to diamond  jim was a reasonable being diamond in her eyes at best only an amiable over-grown baby whom no amount of expostulation would ever bring to talk sense not to say think it now that she could manage the baby as well as he she judged herself altogether his superior towards his father and mother she was all they could wish  diamond had taken a great deal of pains and trouble to find jim and had at last succeeded through the help of the tall policeman who was glad to renew his acquaintance with the strange child jim had moved his quarters and had not heard of nanny's illness till some time after she was taken to the hospital where he was too shy to go and inquire about her but when at length she went to live with diamond's family jim was willing enough to go and see her it was after one of his visits during which they had been talking of her new prospects that nanny expressed to diamond her opinion of the country  there ain't nothing in it but the sun and moon diamond  there's trees and flowers said diamond  well they ain't no count returned nanny  ain't they they're so beautiful they make you happy to look at them  that's because you're such a silly  diamond smiled with a far-away look as if he were gazing through clouds of green leaves and the vision contented him but he was thinking with himself what more he could do for nanny and that same evening he went to find mr raymond for he had heard that he had returned to town  ah how do you do diamond said mr raymond i am glad to see you  and he was indeed for he had grown very fond of him his opinion of him was very different from nanny's  what do you want now my child he asked  i'm always wanting something sir answered diamond  well that's quite right so long as what you want is right everybody is always wanting something only we don't mention it in the right place often enough what is it now  there's a friend of nanny's a lame boy called jim  i've heard of him said mr raymond well  nanny doesn't care much about going to the country sir  well what has that to do with jim  you couldn't find a corner for jim to work in could you sir  i don't know that i couldn't that is if you can show good reason for it  he's a good boy sir  well so much the better for him  i know he can shine boots sir  so much the better for us  you want your boots shined in the country don't you sir  yes to be sure  it wouldn't be nice to walk over the flowers with dirty boots would it sir  no indeed  they wouldn't like it would they  no they wouldn't  then nanny would be better pleased to go sir  if the flowers didn't like dirty boots to walk over them nanny wouldn't mind going to the country is that it i don't quite see it  no sir i didn't mean that i meant if you would take jim with you to clean your boots and do odd jobs you know sir then nanny would like it better she's so fond of jim  now you come to the point diamond i see what you mean exactly i will turn it over in my mind could you bring jim to see me  i'll try sir but they don't mind me much they think i'm silly  added diamond with one of his sweetest smiles  what mr raymond thought i dare hardly attempt to put down here but one part of it was that the highest wisdom must ever appear folly to those who do not possess it  i think he would come though after dark you know diamond continued he does well at shining boots people's kind to lame boys you know sir but after dark there ain't so much doing  diamond succeeded in bringing jim to mr raymond and the consequence was that he resolved to give the boy a chance he provided new clothes for both him and nanny and upon a certain day joseph took his wife and three children and nanny and jim by train to a certain station in the county of kent where they found a cart waiting to carry them and their luggage to the mound which was the name of mr raymond's new residence i will not describe the varied feelings of the party as they went or when they arrived all i will say is that diamond who is my only care was full of quiet delight a gladness too deep to talk about  joseph returned to town the same night and the next morning drove ruby and diamond down with the carriage behind them and mr raymond and a lady in the carriage for mr raymond was an old bachelor no longer  he was bringing his wife with him to live at the mound the moment nanny saw her she recognised her as the lady who had lent her the ruby-ring that ring had been given her by mr raymond  the weather was very hot and the woods very shadowy there were not a great many wild flowers for it was getting well towards autumn and the most of the wild flowers rise early to be before the leaves because if they did not they would never get a glimpse of the sun for them so they have their fun over and are ready to go to bed again by the time the trees are dressed but there was plenty of the loveliest grass and daisies about the house and diamond's chief pleasure seemed to be to lie amongst them and breathe the pure air but all the time he was dreaming of the country at the back of the north wind and trying to recall the songs the river used to sing for this was more like being at the back of the north wind than anything he had known since he left it sometimes he would have his little brother sometimes his little sister and sometimes both of them in the grass with him and then he felt just like a cat with her first kittens he said only he couldn't purr all he could do was to sing  these were very different times from those when he used to drive the cab but you must not suppose that diamond was idle he did not do so much for his mother now because nanny occupied his former place but he helped his father still both in the stable and the harness-room and generally went with him on the box that he might learn to drive a pair and be ready to open the carriage-door mr raymond advised his father to give him plenty of liberty  a boy like that he said ought not to be pushed  joseph assented heartily smiling to himself at the idea of pushing diamond after doing everything that fell to his share the boy had a wealth of time at his disposal and a happy sometimes a merry time it was only for two months or so he neither saw nor heard anything of north wind     chapter xxxv i make diamond's acquaintance   mr raymond's house was called the mound because it stood upon a little steep knoll so smooth and symmetrical that it showed itself at once to be artificial it had beyond doubt been built for queen elizabeth as a hunting tower a place namely from the top of which you could see the country for miles on all sides and so be able to follow with your eyes the flying deer and the pursuing hounds and horsemen the mound had been cast up to give a good basement-advantage over the neighbouring heights and woods there was a great quarry-hole not far off brim-full of water from which as the current legend stated the materials forming the heart of the mound a kind of stone unfit for building had been dug the house itself was of brick and they said the foundations were first laid in the natural level and then the stones and earth of the mound were heaped about and between them so that its great height should be well buttressed  joseph and his wife lived in a little cottage a short way from the house it was a real cottage with a roof of thick thatch which in june and july the wind sprinkled with the red and white petals it shook from the loose topmost sprays of the rose-trees climbing the walls at first diamond had a nest under this thatch a pretty little room with white muslin curtains but afterwards mr and mrs raymond wanted to have him for a page in the house and his father and mother were quite pleased to have him employed without his leaving them so he was dressed in a suit of blue from which his pale face and fair hair came out like the loveliest blossom and took up his abode in the house  would you be afraid to sleep alone diamond asked his mistress  i don't know what you mean ma'am said diamond i never was afraid of anything that i can recollect not much at least  there's a little room at the top of the house all alone she returned perhaps you would not mind sleeping there  i can sleep anywhere and i like best to be high up should i be able to see out  i will show you the place she answered and taking him by the hand she led him up and up the oval-winding stair in one of the two towers  near the top they entered a tiny little room with two windows from which you could see over the whole country diamond clapped his hands with delight  you would like this room then diamond said his mistress  it's the grandest room in the house he answered i shall be near the stars and yet not far from the tops of the trees that's just what i like  i daresay he thought also that it would be a nice place for north wind to call at in passing but he said nothing of that sort below him spread a lake of green leaves with glimpses of grass here and there at the bottom of it as he looked down he saw a squirrel appear suddenly and as suddenly vanish amongst the topmost branches  aha little squirrel he cried my nest is built higher than yours  you can be up here with your books as much as you like said his mistress i will have a little bell hung at the door which i can ring when i want you half-way down the stair is the drawing-room  so diamond was installed as page and his new room got ready for him  it was very soon after this that i came to know diamond i was then a tutor in a family whose estate adjoined the little property belonging to the mound i had made the acquaintance of mr raymond in london some time before and was walking up the drive towards the house to call upon him one fine warm evening when i saw diamond for the first time he was sitting at the foot of a great beech-tree a few yards from the road with a book on his knees he did not see me i walked up behind the tree and peeping over his shoulder saw that he was reading a fairy-book  what are you reading i said and spoke suddenly with the hope of seeing a startled little face look round at me diamond turned his head as quietly as if he were only obeying his mother's voice and the calmness of his face rebuked my unkind desire and made me ashamed of it  i am reading the story of the little lady and the goblin prince said diamond  i am sorry i don't know the story i returned who is it by  mr raymond made it  is he your uncle i asked at a guess  no he's my master  what do you do for him i asked respectfully  anything he wishes me to do he answered i am busy for him now he gave me this story to read he wants my opinion upon it  don't you find it rather hard to make up your mind  oh dear no any story always tells me itself what i'm to think about it mr raymond doesn't want me to say whether it is a clever story or not but whether i like it and why i like it i never can tell what they call clever from what they call silly but i always know whether i like a story or not  and can you always tell why you like it or not  no very often i can't at all sometimes i can i always know but i can't always tell why mr raymond writes the stories and then tries them on me mother does the same when she makes jam she's made such a lot of jam since we came here and she always makes me taste it to see if it'll do mother knows by the face i make whether it will or not  at this moment i caught sight of two more children approaching one was a handsome girl the other a pale-faced awkward-looking boy who limped much on one leg i withdrew a little to see what would follow for they seemed in some consternation after a few hurried words they went off together and i pursued my way to the house where i was as kindly received by mr and mrs raymond as i could have desired from them i learned something of diamond and was in consequence the more glad to find him when i returned seated in the same place as before  what did the boy and girl want with you diamond i asked  they had seen a creature that frightened them  and they came to tell you about it  they couldn't get water out of the well for it so they wanted me to go with them  they're both bigger than you  yes but they were frightened at it  and weren't you frightened at it  no  why  because i'm silly i'm never frightened at things  i could not help thinking of the old meaning of the word silly  and what was it i asked  i think it was a kind of an angel a very little one it had a long body and great wings which it drove about it so fast that they grew a thin cloud all round it it flew backwards and forwards over the well or hung right in the middle making a mist of its wings as if its business was to take care of the water  and what did you do to drive it away  i didn't drive it away i knew whatever the creature was the well was to get water out of so i took the jug dipped it in and drew the water  and what did the creature do  flew about  and it didn't hurt you  no why should it i wasn't doing anything wrong  what did your companions say then  they said `thank you diamond what a dear silly you are'  and weren't you angry with them  no why should i i should like if they would play with me a little but they always like better to go away together when their work is over they never heed me i don't mind it much though the other creatures are friendly they don't run away from me only they're all so busy with their own work they don't mind me much  do you feel lonely then  oh no when nobody minds me i get into my nest and look up and then the sky does mind me and thinks about me  where is your nest  he rose saying i will show you and led me to the other side of the tree  there hung a little rope-ladder from one of the lower boughs the boy climbed up the ladder and got upon the bough then he climbed farther into the leafy branches and went out of sight  after a little while i heard his voice coming down out of the tree  i am in my nest now said the voice  i can't see you i returned  i can't see you either but i can see the first star peeping out of the sky i should like to get up into the sky don't you think i shall some day  yes i do tell me what more you see up there  i don't see anything more except a few leaves and the big sky over me it goes swinging about the earth is all behind my back there comes another star the wind is like kisses from a big lady when i get up here i feel as if i were in north wind's arms  this was the first i heard of north wind  the whole ways and look of the child so full of quiet wisdom yet so ready to accept the judgment of others in his own dispraise took hold of my heart and i felt myself wonderfully drawn towards him it seemed to me somehow as if little diamond possessed the secret of life and was himself what he was so ready to think the lowest living thing an angel of god with something special to say or do a gush of reverence came over me and with a single goodnight i turned and left him in his nest  i saw him often after this and gained so much of his confidence that he told me all i have told you i cannot pretend to account for it i leave that for each philosophical reader to do after his own fashion the easiest way is that of nanny and jim who said often to each other that diamond had a tile loose but mr raymond was much of my opinion concerning the boy while mrs raymond confessed that she often rang her bell just to have once more the pleasure of seeing the lovely stillness of the boy's face with those blue eyes which seemed rather made for other people to look into than for himself to look out of  it was plainer to others than to himself that he felt the desertion of nanny and jim they appeared to regard him as a mere toy except when they found he could minister to the scruple of using him generally with success they were however well-behaved to a wonderful degree while i have little doubt that much of their good behaviour was owing to the unconscious influence of the boy they called god's baby  one very strange thing is that i could never find out where he got some of his many songs at times they would be but bubbles blown out of a nursery rhyme as was the following which i heard him sing one evening to his little dulcimer there were about a score of sheep feeding in a paddock near him their white wool dyed a pale rose in the light of the setting sun those in the long shadows from the trees were dead white those in the sunlight were half glorified with pale rose            little bo peep she lost her sheep             and didn't know where to find them          they were over the height and out of sight             trailing their tails behind them           little bo peep woke out of her sleep             jump'd up and set out to find them           the silly things they've got no wings             and they've left their trails behind them      they've taken their tails but they've left their trails    and so i shall follow and find them     for wherever a tail had dragged a trail    the long grass grew behind them     and day's eyes and butter-cups cow's lips and crow's feet    were glittering in the sun    she threw down her book and caught up her crook    and after her sheep did run     she ran and she ran and ever as she ran    the grass grew higher and higher    till over the hill the sun began    to set in a flame of fire     she ran on still up the grassy hill    and the grass grew higher and higher    when she reached its crown the sun was down    and had left a trail of fire     the sheep and their tails were gone all gone     and no more trail behind them    yes yes  they were there long-tailed and fair    but alas  she could not find them     purple and gold and rosy and blue    with their tails all white behind them    her sheep they did run in the trail of the sun    she saw them but could not find them     after the sun like clouds they did run    but she knew they were her sheep     she sat down to cry and look up at the sky    but she cried herself asleep     and as she slept the dew fell fast    and the wind blew from the sky    and strange things took place that shun the day's face    because they are sweet and shy     nibble nibble crop  she heard as she woke     a hundred little lambs    did pluck and eat the grass so sweet    that grew in the trails of their dams     little bo peep caught up her crook    and wiped the tears that did blind her    and nibble nibble crop without a stop    the lambs came eating behind her     home home she came both tired and lame    with three times as many sheep    in a month or more they'll be as big as before    and then she'll laugh in her sleep     but what would you say if one fine day    when they've got their bushiest tails    their grown up game should be just the same    and she have to follow their trails     never weep bo peep though you lose your sheep    and do not know where to find them    'tis after the sun the mothers have run    and there are their lambs behind them  i confess again to having touched up a little but it loses far more in diamond's sweet voice singing it than it gains by a rhyme here and there  some of them were out of books mr raymond had given him these he always knew but about the others he could seldom tell sometimes he would say i made that one but generally he would say i don't know i found it somewhere or i got it at the back of the north wind  one evening i found him sitting on the grassy slope under the house with his dulcimer in his arms and his little brother rolling on the grass beside them he was chanting in his usual way more like the sound of a brook than anything else i can think of when i went up to them he ceased his chant  do go on diamond don't mind me i said  he began again at once while he sang nanny and jim sat a little way off one hemming a pocket-handkerchief and the other reading a story to her but they never heeded diamond this is as near what he sang as i can recollect or reproduce rather     what would you see if i took you up    to my little nest in the air    you would see the sky like a clear blue cup    turned upside downwards there     what would you do if i took you there    to my little nest in the tree    my child with cries would trouble the air    to get what she could but see     what would you get in the top of the tree    for all your crying and grief    not a star would you clutch of all you see     you could only gather a leaf     but when you had lost your greedy grief    content to see from afar    you would find in your hand a withering leaf    in your heart a shining star  as diamond went on singing it grew very dark and just as he ceased there came a great flash of lightning that blinded us all for a moment dulcimer crowed with pleasure but when the roar of thunder came after it the little brother gave a loud cry of terror nanny and jim came running up to us pale with fear diamond's face too was paler than usual but with delight some of the glory seemed to have clung to it and remained shining  you're not frightened are you diamond i said  no why should i be he answered with his usual question looking up in my face with calm shining eyes  he ain't got sense to be frightened said nanny going up to him and giving him a pitying hug  perhaps there's more sense in not being frightened nanny i returned do you think the lightning can do as it likes  it might kill you said jim  oh no it mightn't said diamond  as he spoke there came another great flash and a tearing crack  there's a tree struck i said and when we looked round after the blinding of the flash had left our eyes we saw a huge bough of the beech-tree in which was diamond's nest hanging to the ground like the broken wing of a bird  there cried nanny i told you so if you had been up there you see what would have happened you little silly  no i don't said diamond and began to sing to dulcimer all i could hear of the song for the other children were going on with their chatter was                        the clock struck one                      and the mouse came down                      dickery dickery dock  then there came a blast of wind and the rain followed in straight-pouring lines as if out of a watering-pot diamond jumped up with his little dulcimer in his arms and nanny caught up the little boy and they ran for the cottage jim vanished with a double shuffle and i went into the house  when i came out again to return home the clouds were gone and the evening sky glimmered through the trees blue and pale-green towards the west i turned my steps a little aside to look at the stricken beech i saw the bough torn from the stem and that was all the twilight would allow me to see while i stood gazing down from the sky came a sound of singing but the voice was neither of lark nor of nightingale  it was sweeter than either  it was the voice of diamond up in his airy nest                         the lightning and thunder                      they go and they come                      but the stars and the stillness                      are always at home  and then the voice ceased  good-night diamond i said  good-night sir answered diamond  as i walked away pondering i saw the great black top of the beech swaying about against the sky in an upper wind and heard the murmur as of many dim half-articulate voices filling the solitude around diamond's nest     chapter xxxvi diamond questions north wind   my readers will not wonder that after this i did my very best to gain the friendship of diamond nor did i find this at all difficult the child was so ready to trust upon one subject alone was he reticent the story of his relations with north wind i fancy he could not quite make up his mind what to think of them at all events it was some little time before he trusted me with this only then he told me everything if i could not regard it all in exactly the same light as he did i was while guiltless of the least pretence fully sympathetic and he was satisfied without demanding of me any theory of difficult points involved i let him see plainly enough that whatever might be the explanation of the marvellous experience i would have given much for a similar one myself  on an evening soon after the thunderstorm in a late twilight with a half-moon high in the heavens i came upon diamond in the act of climbing by his little ladder into the beech-tree  what are you always going up there for diamond i heard nanny ask rather rudely i thought  sometimes for one thing sometimes for another nanny answered diamond looking skywards as he climbed  you'll break your neck some day she said  i'm going up to look at the moon to-night he added without heeding her remark  you'll see the moon just as well down here she returned  i don't think so  you'll be no nearer to her up there  oh yes i shall i must be nearer her you know i wish i could dream as pretty dreams about her as you can nanny  you silly you never have done about that dream i never dreamed but that one and it was nonsense enough i'm sure  it wasn't nonsense it was a beautiful dream and a funny one too both in one  but what's the good of talking about it that way when you know it was only a dream dreams ain't true  that one was true nanny you know it was didn't you come to grief for doing what you were told not to do and isn't that true  i can't get any sense into him exclaimed nanny with an expression of mild despair do you really believe diamond that there's a house in the moon with a beautiful lady and a crooked old man and dusters in it  if there isn't there's something better he answered and vanished in the leaves over our heads  i went into the house where i visited often in the evenings when i came out there was a little wind blowing very pleasant after the heat of the day for although it was late summer now it was still hot the tree-tops were swinging about in it i took my way past the beech and called up to see if diamond were still in his nest in its rocking head  are you there diamond i said  yes sir came his clear voice in reply  isn't it growing too dark for you to get down safely  oh no sir if i take time to it i know my way so well and never let go with one hand till i've a good hold with the other  do be careful i insisted foolishly seeing the boy was as careful as he could be already  i'm coming he returned i've got all the moon i want to-night   i heard a rustling and a rustling drawing nearer and nearer three or four minutes elapsed and he appeared at length creeping down his little ladder i took him in my arms and set him on the ground  thank you sir he said that's the north wind blowing isn't it sir  i can't tell i answered it feels cool and kind and i think it may be but i couldn't be sure except it were stronger for a gentle wind might turn any way amongst the trunks of the trees  i shall know when i get up to my own room said diamond i think i hear my mistress's bell good-night sir  he ran to the house and i went home  his mistress had rung for him only to send him to bed for she was very careful over him and i daresay thought he was not looking well when he reached his own room he opened both his windows one of which looked to the north and the other to the east to find how the wind blew it blew right in at the northern window diamond was very glad for he thought perhaps north wind herself would come now  a real north wind had never blown all the time since he left london but as she always came of herself and never when he was looking for her and indeed almost never when he was thinking of her he shut the east window and went to bed perhaps some of my readers may wonder that he could go to sleep with such an expectation and indeed if i had not known him i should have wondered at it myself but it was one of his peculiarities and seemed nothing strange in him he was so full of quietness that he could go to sleep almost any time if he only composed himself and let the sleep come this time he went fast asleep as usual  but he woke in the dim blue night the moon had vanished he thought he heard a knocking at his door somebody wants me he said to himself and jumping out of bed ran to open it  but there was no one there he closed it again and the noise still continuing found that another door in the room was rattling it belonged to a closet he thought but he had never been able to open it the wind blowing in at the window must be shaking it he would go and see if it was so  the door now opened quite easily but to his surprise instead of a closet he found a long narrow room the moon which was sinking in the west shone in at an open window at the further end the room was low with a coved ceiling and occupied the whole top of the house immediately under the roof it was quite empty the yellow light of the half-moon streamed over the dark floor he was so delighted at the discovery of the strange desolate moonlit place close to his own snug little room that he began to dance and skip about the floor the wind came in through the door he had left open and blew about him as he danced and he kept turning towards it that it might blow in his face he kept picturing to himself the many places lovely and desolate the hill-sides and farm-yards and tree-tops and meadows over which it had blown on its way to the mound and as he danced he grew more and more delighted with the motion and the wind his feet grew stronger and his body lighter until at length it seemed as if he were borne up on the air and could almost fly so strong did his feeling become that at last he began to doubt whether he was not in one of those precious dreams he had so often had in which he floated about on the air at will but something made him look up and to his unspeakable delight he found his uplifted hands lying in those of north wind who was dancing with him round and round the long bare room her hair now falling to the floor now filling the arched ceiling her eyes shining on him like thinking stars and the sweetest of grand smiles playing breezily about her beautiful mouth she was as so often before of the height of a rather tall lady she did not stoop in order to dance with him but held his hands high in hers when he saw her he gave one spring and his arms were about her neck and her arms holding him to her bosom the same moment she swept with him through the open window in at which the moon was shining made a circuit like a bird about to alight and settled with him in his nest on the top of the great beech-tree there she placed him on her lap and began to hush him as if he were her own baby and diamond was so entirely happy that he did not care to speak a word at length however he found that he was going to sleep and that would be to lose so much that pleasant as it was he could not consent  please dear north wind he said i am so happy that i'm afraid it's a dream how am i to know that it's not a dream  what does it matter returned north wind  i should cry said diamond  but why should you cry the dream if it is a dream is a pleasant one is it not  that's just why i want it to be true  have you forgotten what you said to nanny about her dream  it's not for the dream itself i mean it's not for the pleasure of it answered diamond for i have that whether it be a dream or not it's for you north wind i can't bear to find it a dream because then i should lose you you would be nobody then and i could not bear that you ain't a dream are you dear north wind do say no else i shall cry and come awake and you'll be gone for ever i daren't dream about you once again if you ain't anybody  i'm either not a dream or there's something better that's not a dream diamond said north wind in a rather sorrowful tone he thought  but it's not something better it's you i want north wind he persisted already beginning to cry a little  she made no answer but rose with him in her arms and sailed away over the tree-tops till they came to a meadow where a flock of sheep was feeding  do you remember what the song you were singing a week ago says about bo-peep how she lost her sheep but got twice as many lambs asked north wind sitting down on the grass and placing him in her lap as before  oh yes i do well enough answered diamond but i never just quite liked that rhyme  why not child  because it seems to say one's as good as another or two new ones are better than one that's lost i've been thinking about it a great deal and it seems to me that although any one sixpence is as good as any other sixpence not twenty lambs would do instead of one sheep whose face you knew somehow when once you've looked into anybody's eyes right deep down into them i mean nobody will do for that one any more nobody ever so beautiful or so good will make up for that one going out of sight so you see north wind i can't help being frightened to think that perhaps i am only dreaming and you are nowhere at all do tell me that you are my own real beautiful north wind  again she rose and shot herself into the air as if uneasy because she could not answer him and diamond lay quiet in her arms waiting for what she would say he tried to see up into her face for he was dreadfully afraid she was not answering him because she could not say that she was not a dream but she had let her hair fall all over her face so that he could not see it this frightened him still more  do speak north wind he said at last  i never speak when i have nothing to say she replied  then i do think you must be a real north wind and no dream said diamond  but i'm looking for something to say all the time  but i don't want you to say what's hard to find if you were to say one word to comfort me that wasn't true then i should know you must be a dream for a great beautiful lady like you could never tell a lie  but she mightn't know how to say what she had to say so that a little boy like you would understand it said north wind here let us get down again and i will try to tell you what i think you musn't suppose i am able to answer all your questions though there are a great many things i don't understand more than you do  she descended on a grassy hillock in the midst of a wild furzy common there was a rabbit-warren underneath and some of the rabbits came out of their holes in the moonlight looking very sober and wise just like patriarchs standing in their tent-doors and looking about them before going to bed when they saw north wind instead of turning round and vanishing again with a thump of their heels they cantered slowly up to her and snuffled all about her with their long upper lips which moved every way at once that was their way of kissing her and as she talked to diamond she would every now and then stroke down their furry backs or lift and play with their long ears they would diamond thought have leaped upon her lap but that he was there already  i think said she after they had been sitting silent for a while that if i were only a dream you would not have been able to love me so you love me when you are not with me don't you  indeed i do answered diamond stroking her hand i see i see how could i be able to love you as i do if you weren't there at all you know besides i couldn't be able to dream anything half so beautiful all out of my own head or if i did i couldn't love a fancy of my own like that could i  i think not you might have loved me in a dream dreamily and forgotten me when you woke i daresay but not loved me like a real being as you love me even then i don't think you could dream anything that hadn't something real like it somewhere but you've seen me in many shapes diamond  you remember i was a wolf once don't you  oh yes a good wolf that frightened a naughty drunken nurse  well suppose i were to turn ugly would you rather i weren't a dream then  yes for i should know that you were beautiful inside all the same you would love me and i should love you all the same i shouldn't like you to look ugly you know but i shouldn't believe it a bit  not if you saw it  no not if i saw it ever so plain  there's my diamond i will tell you all i know about it then i don't think i am just what you fancy me to be i have to shape myself various ways to various people but the heart of me is true people call me by dreadful names and think they know all about me but they don't sometimes they call me bad fortune sometimes evil chance sometimes ruin and they have another name for me which they think the most dreadful of all  what is that asked diamond smiling up in her face  i won't tell you that name do you remember having to go through me to get into the country at my back  oh yes i do how cold you were north wind and so white all but your lovely eyes my heart grew like a lump of ice and then i forgot for a while  you were very near knowing what they call me then would you be afraid of me if you had to go through me again  no why should i indeed i should be glad enough if it was only to get another peep of the country at your back  you've never seen it yet  haven't i north wind oh i'm so sorry i thought i had what did i see then  only a picture of it the real country at my real back is ever so much more beautiful than that you shall see it one day perhaps before very long  do they sing songs there  don't you remember the dream you had about the little boys that dug for the stars  yes that i do i thought you must have had something to do with that dream it was so beautiful  yes i gave you that dream  oh thank you did you give nanny her dream too about the moon and the bees  yes i was the lady that sat at the window of the moon  oh thank you i was almost sure you had something to do with that too and did you tell mr raymond the story about the princess daylight  i believe i had something to do with it at all events he thought about it one night when he couldn't sleep but i want to ask you whether you remember the song the boy-angels sang in that dream of yours  no i couldn't keep it do what i would and i did try  that was my fault  how could that be north wind  because i didn't know it properly myself and so i couldn't teach it to you i could only make a rough guess at something like what it would be and so i wasn't able to make you dream it hard enough to remember it nor would i have done so if i could for it was not correct i made you dream pictures of it though but you will hear the very song itself when you do get to the back of    my own dear north wind said diamond finishing the sentence for her and kissing the arm that held him leaning against her  and now we've settled all this for the time at least said north wind  but i can't feel quite sure yet said diamond  you must wait a while for that meantime you may be hopeful and content not to be quite sure come now i will take you home again for it won't do to tire you too much  oh no no i'm not the least tired pleaded diamond  it is better though  very well if you wish it yielded diamond with a sigh  you are a dear good boy said north wind i will come for you again to-morrow night and take you out for a longer time we shall make a little journey together in fact we shall start earlier and as the moon will be later we shall have a little moonlight all the way  she rose and swept over the meadow and the trees in a few moments the mound appeared below them she sank a little and floated in at the window of diamond's room there she laid him on his bed covered him over and in a moment he was lapt in a dreamless sleep     chapter xxxvii once more   the next night diamond was seated by his open window with his head on his hand rather tired but so eagerly waiting for the promised visit that he was afraid he could not sleep but he started suddenly and found that he had been already asleep he rose and looking out of the window saw something white against his beech-tree it was north wind she was holding by one hand to a top branch her hair and her garments went floating away behind her over the tree whose top was swaying about while the others were still  are you ready diamond she asked  yes answered diamond quite ready  in a moment she was at the window and her arms came in and took him she sailed away so swiftly that he could at first mark nothing but the speed with which the clouds above and the dim earth below went rushing past but soon he began to see that the sky was very lovely with mottled clouds all about the moon on which she threw faint colours like those of mother-of-pearl or an opal the night was warm and in the lady's arms he did not feel the wind which down below was making waves in the ripe corn and ripples on the rivers and lakes at length they descended on the side of an open earthy hill just where from beneath a stone a spring came bubbling out  i am going to take you along this little brook said north wind i am not wanted for anything else to-night so i can give you a treat  she stooped over the stream and holding diamond down close to the surface of it glided along level with its flow as it ran down the hill and the song of the brook came up into diamond's ears and grew and grew and changed with every turn it seemed to diamond to be singing the story of its life to him and so it was it began with a musical tinkle which changed to a babble and then to a gentle rushing sometimes its song would almost cease and then break out again tinkle babble and rush all at once at the bottom of the hill they came to a small river into which the brook flowed with a muffled but merry sound along the surface of the river darkly clear below them in the moonlight they floated now where it widened out into a little lake they would hover for a moment over a bed of water-lilies and watch them swing about folded in sleep as the water on which they leaned swayed in the presence of north wind and now they would watch the fishes asleep among their roots below sometimes she would hold diamond over a deep hollow curving into the bank that he might look far into the cool stillness sometimes she would leave the river and sweep across a clover-field the bees were all at home and the clover was asleep then she would return and follow the river it grew wider and wider as it went now the armies of wheat and of oats would hang over its rush from the opposite banks now the willows would dip low branches in its still waters and now it would lead them through stately trees and grassy banks into a lovely garden where the roses and lilies were asleep the tender flowers quite folded up and only a few wide-awake and sending out their life in sweet strong odours wider and wider grew the stream until they came upon boats lying along its banks which rocked a little in the flutter of north wind's garments then came houses on the banks each standing in a lovely lawn with grand trees and in parts the river was so high that some of the grass and the roots of some of the trees were under water and diamond as they glided through between the stems could see the grass at the bottom of the water then they would leave the river and float about and over the houses one after another beautiful rich houses which like fine trees had taken centuries to grow there was scarcely a light to be seen and not a movement to be heard  all the people in them lay fast asleep  what a lot of dreams they must be dreaming said diamond  yes returned north wind they can't surely be all lies can they  i should think it depends a little on who dreams them suggested diamond  yes said north wind the people who think lies and do lies are very likely to dream lies but the people who love what is true will surely now and then dream true things but then something depends on whether the dreams are home-grown or whether the seed of them is blown over somebody else's garden-wall ah there's some one awake in this house  they were floating past a window in which a light was burning diamond heard a moan and looked up anxiously in north wind's face  it's a lady said north wind she can't sleep for pain  couldn't you do something for her said diamond  no i can't but you could  what could i do  sing a little song to her  she wouldn't hear me  i will take you in and then she will hear you  but that would be rude wouldn't it you can go where you please of course but i should have no business in her room  you may trust me diamond i shall take as good care of the lady as of you the window is open come  by a shaded lamp a lady was seated in a white wrapper trying to read but moaning every minute north wind floated behind her chair set diamond down and told him to sing something he was a little frightened but he thought a while and then sang               the sun is gone down            and the moon's in the sky            but the sun will come up            and the moon be laid by             the flower is asleep            but it is not dead            when the morning shines            it will lift its head             when winter comes            it will die no no            it will only hide            from the frost and the snow             sure is the summer            sure is the sun            the night and the winter            are shadows that run  the lady never lifted her eyes from her book or her head from her hand  as soon as diamond had finished north wind lifted him and carried him away  didn't the lady hear me asked diamond when they were once more floating down the river  oh yes she heard you answered north wind  was she frightened then  oh no  why didn't she look to see who it was  she didn't know you were there  how could she hear me then  she didn't hear you with her ears  what did she hear me with  with her heart  where did she think the words came from  she thought they came out of the book she was reading she will search all through it to-morrow to find them and won't be able to understand it at all  oh what fun said diamond what will she do  i can tell you what she won't do  she'll never forget the meaning of them and she'll never be able to remember the words of them  if she sees them in mr raymond's book it will puzzle her won't it  yes that it will she will never be able to understand it  until she gets to the back of the north wind suggested diamond  until she gets to the back of the north wind assented the lady  oh cried diamond i know now where we are oh do let me go into the old garden and into mother's room and diamond's stall i wonder if the hole is at the back of my bed still i should like to stay there all the rest of the night it won't take you long to get home from here will it north wind  no she answered you shall stay as long as you like  oh how jolly cried diamond as north wind sailed over the house with him and set him down on the lawn at the back  diamond ran about the lawn for a little while in the moonlight he found part of it cut up into flower-beds and the little summer-house with the coloured glass and the great elm-tree gone he did not like this and ran into the stable there were no horses there at all he ran upstairs the rooms were empty the only thing left that he cared about was the hole in the wall where his little bed had stood and that was not enough to make him wish to stop he ran down the stair again and out upon the lawn there he threw himself down and began to cry it was all so dreary and lost  i thought i liked the place so much said diamond to himself but i find i don't care about it i suppose it's only the people in it that make you like a place and when they're gone it's dead and you don't care a bit about it north wind told me i might stop as long as i liked and i've stopped longer already north wind he cried aloud turning his face towards the sky  the moon was under a cloud and all was looking dull and dismal a star shot from the sky and fell in the grass beside him the moment it lighted there stood north wind  oh cried diamond joyfully were you the shooting star  yes my child  did you hear me call you then  yes  so high up as that  yes i heard you quite well  do take me home  have you had enough of your old home already  yes more than enough it isn't a home at all now  i thought that would be it said north wind everything dreaming and all has got a soul in it or else it's worth nothing and we don't care a bit about it some of our thoughts are worth nothing because they've got no soul in them the brain puts them into the mind not the mind into the brain  but how can you know about that north wind you haven't got a body  if i hadn't you wouldn't know anything about me no creature can know another without the help of a body but i don't care to talk about that it is time for you to go home  so saying north wind lifted diamond and bore him away     chapter xxxviii at the back of the north wind   i did not see diamond for a week or so after this and then he told me what i have now told you i should have been astonished at his being able even to report such conversations as he said he had had with north wind had i not known already that some children are profound in metaphysics but a fear crosses me lest by telling so much about my friend i should lead people to mistake him for one of those consequential priggish little monsters who are always trying to say clever things and looking to see whether people appreciate them when a child like that dies instead of having a silly book written about him he should be stuffed like one of those awful big-headed fishes you see in museums but diamond never troubled his head about what people thought of him he never set up for knowing better than others the wisest things he said came out when he wanted one to help him with some difficulty he was in he was not even offended with nanny and jim for calling him a silly he supposed there was something in it though he could not quite understand what i suspect however that the other name they gave him god's baby had some share in reconciling him to it  happily for me i was as much interested in metaphysics as diamond himself and therefore while he recounted his conversations with north wind i did not find myself at all in a strange sea although certainly i could not always feel the bottom being indeed convinced that the bottom was miles away  could it be all dreaming do you think sir he asked anxiously  i daren't say diamond i answered but at least there is one thing you may be sure of that there is a still better love than that of the wonderful being you call north wind even if she be a dream the dream of such a beautiful creature could not come to you by chance  yes i know returned diamond i know  then he was silent but i confess appeared more thoughtful than satisfied  the next time i saw him he looked paler than usual  have you seen your friend again i asked him  yes he answered solemnly  did she take you out with her  no she did not speak to me i woke all at once as i generally do when i am going to see her and there she was against the door into the big room sitting just as i saw her sit on her own doorstep as white as snow and her eyes as blue as the heart of an iceberg she looked at me but never moved or spoke  weren't you afraid i asked  no why should i have been he answered i only felt a little cold  did she stay long  i don't know i fell asleep again i think i have been rather cold ever since though he added with a smile  i did not quite like this but i said nothing  four days after i called again at the mound the maid who opened the door looked grave but i suspected nothing when i reached the drawing-room i saw mrs raymond had been crying  haven't you heard she said seeing my questioning looks  i've heard nothing i answered  this morning we found our dear little diamond lying on the floor of the big attic-room just outside his own door fast asleep as we thought but when we took him up we did not think he was asleep we saw that    here the kind-hearted lady broke out crying afresh  may i go and see him i asked  yes she sobbed you know your way to the top of the tower  i walked up the winding stair and entered his room a lovely figure as white and almost as clear as alabaster was lying on the bed i saw at once how it was they thought he was dead i knew that he had gone to the back of the north wind\",\n          \"the light princess   contents     1  what no children    2  won't i just    3  she can't be ours    4  where is she    5  what is to be done    6  she laughs too much    7  try metaphysics    8  try a drop of water    9  put me in again   10  look at the moon   11  hiss   12  where is the prince   13  here i am   14  this is very kind of you   15  look at the rain     1  what no children   once upon a time so long ago that i have quite forgotten the date there lived a king and queen who had no children  and the king said to himself all the queens of my acquaintance have children some three some seven and some as many as twelve and my queen has not one  i feel ill-used  so he made up his mind to be cross with his wife about it  but she bore it all like a good patient queen as she was  then the king grew very cross indeed  but the queen pretended to take it all as a joke and a very good one too  why don't you have any daughters at least said he  i don't say sons that might be too much to expect  i am sure dear king i am very sorry said the queen  so you ought to be retorted the king you are not going to make a virtue of that surely  but he was not an ill-tempered king and in any matter of less moment would have let the queen have her own way with all his heart  this however was an affair of state  the queen smiled  you must have patience with a lady you know dear king said she  she was indeed a very nice queen and heartily sorry that she could not oblige the king immediately    2  won't i just  the king tried to have patience but he succeeded very badly  it was more than he deserved therefore when at last the queen gave him a daughter as lovely a little princess as ever cried  the day drew near when the infant must be christened  the king wrote all the invitations with his own hand  of course somebody was forgotten  now it does not generally matter if somebody is forgotten only you must mind who  unfortunately the king forgot without intending to forget and so the chance fell upon the princess makemnoit which was awkward  for the princess was the king's own sister and he ought not to have forgotten her  but she had made herself so disagreeable to the old king their father that he had forgotten her in making his will and so it was no wonder that her brother forgot her in writing his invitations  but poor relations don't do anything to keep you in mind of them  why don't they  the king could not see into the garret she lived in could he  she was a sour spiteful creature  the wrinkles of contempt crossed the wrinkles of peevishness and made her face as full of wrinkles as a pat of butter  if ever a king could be justified in forgetting anybody this king was justified in forgetting his sister even at a christening  she looked very odd too  her forehead was as large as all the rest of her face and projected over it like a precipice  when she was angry her little eyes flashed blue  when she hated anybody they shone yellow and green  what they looked like when she loved anybody i do not know for i never heard of her loving anybody but herself and i do not think she could have managed that if she had not somehow got used to herself  but what made it highly imprudent in the king to forget her was that she was awfully clever  in fact she was a witch and when she bewitched anybody he very soon had enough of it for she beat all the wicked fairies in wickedness and all the clever ones in cleverness  she despised all the modes we read of in history in which offended fairies and witches have taken their revenges and therefore after waiting and waiting in vain for an invitation she made up her mind at last to go without one and make the whole family miserable like a princess as she was  so she put on her best gown went to the palace was kindly received by the happy monarch who forgot that he had forgotten her and took her place in the procession to the royal chapel  when they were all gathered about the font she contrived to get next to it and throw something into the water after which she maintained a very respectful demeanour till the water was applied to the child's face  but at that moment she turned round in her place three times and muttered the following words loud enough for those beside her to hear      light of spirit by my charms   light of body every part   never weary human arms    only crush thy parents' heart   they all thought she had lost her wits and was repeating some foolish nursery rhyme but a shudder went through the whole of them notwithstanding  the baby on the contrary began to laugh and crow while the nurse gave a start and a smothered cry for she thought she was struck with paralysis  she could not feel the baby in her arms but she clasped it tight and said nothing  the mischief was done    3  she can't be ours  her atrocious aunt had deprived the child of all her gravity  if you ask me how this was effected i answer in the easiest way in the world  she had only to destroy gravitation  for the princess was a philosopher and knew all the ins and outs of the laws of gravitation as well as the ins and outs of her boot-lace  and being a witch as well she could abrogate those laws in a moment or at least so clog their wheels and rust their bearings that they would not work at all but we have more to do with what followed than with how it was done  the first awkwardness that resulted from this unhappy privation was that the moment the nurse began to float the baby up and down she flew from her arms towards the ceiling  happily the resistance of the air brought her ascending career to a close within a foot of it  there she remained horizontal as when she left her nurse's arms kicking and laughing amazingly  the nurse in terror flew to the bell and begged the footman who answered it to bring up the house-steps directly trembling in every limb she climbed upon the steps and had to stand upon the very top and reach up before she could catch the floating tail of the baby's long clothes  when the strange fact came to be known there was a terrible commotion in the palace  the occasion of its discovery by the king was naturally a repetition of the nurse's experience  astonished that he felt no weight when the child was laid in his arms he began to wave her up and not down for she slowly ascended to the ceiling as before and there remained floating in perfect comfort and satisfaction as was testified by her peals of tiny laughter  the king stood staring up in speechless amazement and trembled so that his beard shook like grass in the wind at last turning to the queen who was just as horror-struck as himself he said gasping staring and stammering   she can't be ours queen  now the queen was much cleverer than the king and had begun already to suspect that this effect defective came by cause  i am sure she is ours answered she  but we ought to have taken better care of her at the christening  people who were never invited ought not to have been present  oh ho said the king tapping his forehead with his forefinger i have it all  i've found her out  don't you see it queen  princess makemnoit has bewitched her that's just what i say answered the queen  i beg your pardon my love i did not hear you john bring the steps i get on my throne with  for he was a little king with a great throne like many other kings  the throne-steps were brought and set upon the dining-table and john got upon the top of them  but he could not reach the little princess who lay like a baby-laughter-cloud in the air exploding continuously take the tongs john said his majesty and getting up on the table he handed them to him  john could reach the baby now and the little princess was handed down by the tongs    4  where is she  one fine summer day a month after these her first adventures during which time she had been very carefully watched the princess was lying on the bed in the queen's own chamber fast asleep  one of the windows was open for it was noon and the day was so sultry that the little girl was wrapped in nothing less ethereal than slumber itself  the queen came into the room and not observing that the baby was on the bed opened another window  a frolicsome fairy wind which had been watching for a chance of mischief rushed in at the one window and taking its way over the bed where the child was lying caught her up and rolling and floating her along like a piece of flue or a dandelion seed carried her with it through the opposite window and away  the queen went down-stairs quite ignorant of the loss she had herself occasioned  when the nurse returned she supposed that her majesty had carried her off and dreading a scolding delayed making inquiry about her  but hearing nothing she grew uneasy and went at length to the queen's boudoir where she found her majesty  please your majesty shall i take the baby said she  where is she asked the queen  please forgive me  i know it was wrong  what do you mean said the queen looking grave  oh don't frighten me your majesty exclaimed the nurse clasping her hands  the queen saw that something was amiss and fell down in a faint  the nurse rushed about the palace screaming my baby my baby  every one ran to the queen's room  but the queen could give no orders they soon found out however that the princess was missing and in a moment the palace was like a beehive in a garden and in one minute more the queen was brought to herself by a great shout and a clapping of hands  they had found the princess fast asleep under a rose-bush to which the elvish little wind-puff had carried her finishing its mischief by shaking a shower of red rose-leaves all over the little white sleeper  startled by the noise the servants made she woke and furious with glee scattered the rose-leaves in all directions like a shower of spray in the sunset  she was watched more carefully after this no doubt yet it would be endless to relate all the odd incidents resulting from this peculiarity of the young princess  but there never was a baby in a house not to say a palace that kept the household in such constant good humour at least below-stairs  if it was not easy for her nurses to hold her at least she made neither their arms nor their hearts ache  and she was so nice to play at ball with  there was positively no danger of letting her fall  they might throw her down or knock her down or push her down but couldn't let her down  it is true they might let her fly into the fire or the coal-hole or through the window but none of these accidents had happened as yet  if you heard peals of laughter resounding from some unknown region you might be sure enough of the cause  going down into the kitchen or the room you would find jane and thomas and robert and susan all and sum playing at ball with the little princess  she was the ball herself and did not enjoy it the less for that  away she went flying from one to another screeching with laughter  and the servants loved the ball itself better even than the game  but they had to take some care how they threw her for if she received an upward direction she would never come down again without being fetched    5  what is to be done  but above-stairs it was different  one day for instance after breakfast the king went into his counting-house and counted out his money  the operation gave him no pleasure  to think said he to himself that every one of these gold sovereigns weighs a quarter of an ounce and my real live flesh-and-blood princess weighs nothing at all  and he hated his gold sovereigns as they lay with a broad smile of self-satisfaction all over their yellow faces  the queen was in the parlour eating bread and honey  but at the second mouthful she burst out crying and could not swallow it  the king heard her sobbing  glad of anybody but especially of his queen to quarrel with he clashed his gold sovereigns into his money-box clapped his crown on his head and rushed into the parlour  what is all this about exclaimed he  what are you crying for queen  i can't eat it said the queen looking ruefully at the honey-pot  no wonder retorted the king  you've just eaten your breakfast two turkey eggs and three anchovies  oh that's not it sobbed her majesty  it's my child my child  well what's the matter with your child  she's neither up the chimney nor down the draw-well  just hear her laughing  yet the king could not help a sigh which he tried to turn into a cough saying   it is a good thing to be light-hearted i am sure whether she be ours or not  it is a bad thing to be light-headed answered the queen looking with prophetic soul far into the future  'tis a good thing to be light-handed said the king  'tis a bad thing to be light-fingered answered the queen  'tis a good thing to be light-footed said the king  'tis a bad thing  began the queen but the king interrupted her  in fact said he with the tone of one who concludes an argument in which he has had only imaginary opponents and in which therefore he has come off triumphant in fact it is a good thing altogether to be light-bodied  but it is a bad thing altogether to be light-minded retorted the queen who was beginning to lose her temper  this last answer quite discomfited his majesty who turned on his heel and betook himself to his counting-house again  but he was not half-way towards it when the voice of his queen overtook him  and it's a bad thing to be light-haired screamed she determined to have more last words now that her spirit was roused  the queen's hair was black as night and the king's had been and his daughter's was golden as morning  but it was not this reflection on his hair that arrested him it was the double use of the word light for the king hated all witticisms and punning especially  and besides he could not tell whether the queen meant light-haired or light-heired for why might she not aspirate her vowels when she was exasperated herself  he turned upon his other heel and rejoined her  she looked angry still because she knew that she was guilty or what was much the same knew that he thought so  my dear queen said he duplicity of any sort is exceedingly objectionable between married people of any rank not to say kings and queens and the most objectionable form duplicity can assume is that of punning  there said the queen i never made a jest but i broke it in the making  i am the most unfortunate woman in the world  she looked so rueful that the king took her in his arms and they sat down to consult  can you bear this said the king  no i can't said the queen  well what's to be done said the king  i'm sure i don't know said the queen  but might you not try an apology  to my old sister i suppose you mean said the king  yes said the queen  well i don't mind said the king  so he went the next morning to the house of the princess and making a very humble apology begged her to undo the spell  but the princess declared with a grave face that she knew nothing at all about it her eyes however shone pink which was a sign that she was happy she advised the king and queen to have patience and to mend their ways  the king returned disconsolate  the queen tried to comfort him  we will wait till she is older  she may then be able to suggest something herself  she will know at least how she feels and explain things to us  but what if she should marry exclaimed the king in sudden consternation at the idea  well what of that rejoined the queen  just think  if she were to have children  in the course of a hundred years the air might be as full of floating children as of gossamers in autumn  that is no business of ours replied the queen  besides by that time they will have learned to take care of themselves  a sigh was the king's only answer  he would have consulted the court physicians but he was afraid they would try experiments upon her    6  she laughs too much  meantime notwithstanding awkward occurrences and griefs that she brought upon her parents the little princess laughed and grew not fat but plump and tall  she reached the age of seventeen without having fallen into any worse scrape than a chimney by rescuing her from which a little bird-nesting urchin got fame and a black face nor thoughtless as she was had she committed anything worse than laughter at everybody and everything that came in her way  when she was told for the sake of experiment that general clanrunfort was cut to pieces with all his troops she laughed when she heard that the enemy was on his way to besiege her papa's capital she laughed hugely but when she was told that the city would certainly be abandoned to the mercy of the enemy's soldiery why then she laughed immoderately  she never could be brought to see the serious side of anything  when her mother cried she said   what queer faces mamma makes  and she squeezes water out of her cheeks  funny mamma  and when her papa stormed at her she laughed and danced round and round him clapping her hands and crying   do it again papa  do it again  it's such fun  dear funny papa  and if he tried to catch her she glided from him in an instant not in the least afraid of him but thinking it part of the game not to be caught  with one push of her foot she would be floating in the air above his head or she would go dancing backwards and forwards and sideways like a great butterfly  it happened several times when her father and mother were holding a consultation about her in private that they were interrupted by vainly repressed outbursts of laughter over their heads and looking up with indignation saw her floating at full length in the air above them whence she regarded them with the most comical appreciation of the position  one day an awkward accident happened  the princess had come out upon the lawn with one of her attendants who held her by the hand  spying her father at the other side of the lawn she snatched her hand from the maid's and sped across to him  now when she wanted to run alone her custom was to catch up a stone in each hand so that she might come down again after a bound  whatever she wore as part of her attire had no effect in this way  even gold when it thus became as it were a part of herself lost all its weight for the time  but whatever she only held in her hands retained its downward tendency  on this occasion she could see nothing to catch up but a huge toad that was walking across the lawn as if he had a hundred years to do it in  not knowing what disgust meant for this was one of her peculiarities she snatched up the toad and bounded away  she had almost reached her father and he was holding out his arms to receive her and take from her lips the kiss which hovered on them like a butterfly on a rosebud when a puff of wind blew her aside into the arms of a young page who had just been receiving a message from his majesty  now it was no great peculiarity in the princess that once she was set agoing it always cost her time and trouble to check herself  on this occasion there was no time  she must kiss-and she kissed the page  she did not mind it much for she had no shyness in her composition and she knew besides that she could not help it  so she only laughed like a musical box  the poor page fared the worst  for the princess trying to correct the unfortunate tendency of the kiss put out her hands to keep her off the page so that along with the kiss he received on the other cheek a slap with the huge black toad which she poked right into his eye  he tried to laugh too but the attempt resulted in such an odd contortion of countenance as showed that there was no danger of his pluming himself on the kiss  as for the king his dignity was greatly hurt and he did not speak to the page for a whole month  i may here remark that it was very amusing to see her run if her mode of progression could properly be called running  for first she would make a bound then having alighted she would run a few steps and make another bound  sometimes she would fancy she had reached the ground before she actually had and her feet would go backwards and forwards running upon nothing at all like those of a chicken on its back  then she would laugh like the very spirit of fun only in her laugh there was something missing  what it was i find myself unable to describe  i think it was a certain tone depending upon the possibility of sorrow morbidezza perhaps  she never smiled    7  try metaphysics  after a long avoidance of the painful subject the king and queen resolved to hold a council of three upon it and so they sent for the princess  in she came sliding and flitting and gliding from one piece of furniture to another and put herself at last in an armchair in a sitting posture  whether she could be said to sit seeing she received no support from the seat of the chair i do not pretend to determine  my dear child said the king you must be aware by this time that you are not exactly like other people  oh you dear funny papa  i have got a nose and two eyes and all the rest  so have you  so has mamma  now be serious my dear for once said the queen  no thank you mamma i had rather not  would you not like to be able to walk like other people said the king  no indeed i should think not  you only crawl  you are such slow coaches  how do you feel my child he resumed after a pause of discomfiture  quite well thank you  i mean what do you feel like  like nothing at all that i know of  you must feel like something  i feel like a princess with such a funny papa and such a dear pet of a queen-mamma  now really began the queen but the princess interrupted her  oh yes she added i remember  i have a curious feeling sometimes as if i were the only person that had any sense in the whole world  she had been trying to behave herself with dignity but now she burst into a violent fit of laughter threw herself backwards over the chair and went rolling about the floor in an ecstasy of enjoyment  the king picked her up easier than one does a down quilt and replaced her in her former relation to the chair  the exact preposition expressing this relation i do not happen to know  is there nothing you wish for resumed the king who had learned by this time that it was useless to be angry with her  oh you dear papa yes answered she  what is it my darling  i have been longing for it oh such a time ever since last night tell me what it is  will you promise to let me have it  the king was on the point of saying yes but the wiser queen checked him with a single motion of her head  tell me what it is first said he  no no  promise first  i dare not  what is it  mind i hold you to your promise it is to be tied to the end of a string a very long string indeed and be flown like a kite  oh such fun  i would rain rose-water and hail sugar-plums and snow whipped-cream and and and   a fit of laughing checked her and she would have been off again over the floor had not the king started up and caught her just in time seeing nothing but talk could be got out of her he rang the bell and sent her away with two of her ladies-in-waiting  now queen he said turning to her majesty what is to be done  there is but one thing left answered she  let us consult the college of metaphysicians  bravo cried the king we will  now at the head of this college were two very wise chinese philosophers-by name hum-drum and kopy-keck  for them the king sent and straightway they came  in a long speech he communicated to them what they knew very well already as who did not namely the peculiar condition of his daughter in relation to the globe on which she dwelt and requested them to consult together as to what might be the cause and probable cure of her infirmity  the king laid stress upon the word but failed to discover his own pun  the queen laughed but hum-drum and kopy-keck heard with humility and retired in silence  the consultation consisted chiefly in propounding and supporting for the thousandth time each his favourite theories  for the condition of the princess afforded delightful scope for the discussion of every question arising from the division of thought-in fact of all the metaphysics of the chinese empire  but it is only justice to say that they did not altogether neglect the discussion of the practical question what was to be done  hum-drum was a materialist and kopy-keck was a spiritualist  the former was slow and sententious the latter was quick and flighty  the latter had generally the first word the former the last  i reassert my former assertion began kopy-keck with a plunge there is not a fault in the princess body or soul only they are wrong put together  listen to me now hum-drum and i will tell you in brief what i think  don't speak  don't answer me  i won't hear you till i have done   at that decisive moment when souls seek their appointed habitations two eager souls met struck rebounded lost their way and arrived each at the wrong place  the soul of the princess was one of those and she went far astray  she does not belong by rights to this world at all but to some other planet probably mercury  her proclivity to her true sphere destroys all the natural influence which this orb would otherwise possess over her corporeal frame  she cares for nothing here  there is no relation between her and this world  she must therefore be taught by the sternest compulsion to take an interest in the earth as the earth  she must study every department of its history its animal history its vegetable history its mineral history its social history its moral history its political history its scientific history its literary history its musical history its artistical history above all its metaphysical history  she must begin with the chinese dynasty and end with japan  but first of all she must study geology and especially the history of the extinct races of animals-their natures their habits their loves their hates their revenges  she must   hold h-o-o-old roared hum-drum  it is certainly my turn now  my rooted and insubvertible conviction is that the causes of the anomalies evident in the princess's condition are strictly and solely physical  but that is only tantamount to acknowledging that they exist  hear my opinion   from some cause or other of no importance to our inquiry the motion of her heart has been reversed  that remarkable combination of the suction and the force-pump works the wrong way-i mean in the case of the unfortunate princess  it draws in where it should force out and forces out where it should draw in  the offices of the auricles and the ventricles are subverted  the blood is sent forth by the veins and returns by the arteries  consequently it is running the wrong way through all her corporeal organism lungs and all  is it then at all mysterious seeing that such is the case that on the other particular of gravitation as well she should differ from normal humanity  my proposal for the cure is this    phlebotomize until she is reduced to the last point of safety  let it be effected if necessary in a warm bath  when she is reduced to a state of perfect asphyxy apply a ligature to the left ankle drawing it as tight as the bone will bear  apply at the same moment another of equal tension around the right wrist  by means of plates constructed for the purpose place the other foot and hand under the receivers of two air-pumps  exhaust the receivers  exhibit a pint of french brandy and await the result  which would presently arrive in the form of grim death said kopy-keck  if it should she would yet die in doing our duty retorted hum-drum  but their majesties had too much tenderness for their volatile offspring to subject her to either of the schemes of the equally unscrupulous philosophers  indeed the most complete knowledge of the laws of nature would have been unserviceable in her case for it was impossible to classify her  she was a fifth imponderable body sharing all the other properties of the ponderable    8  try a drop of water  perhaps the best thing for the princess would have been to fall in love  but how a princess who had no gravity could fall into anything is a difficulty perhaps the difficulty  as for her own feelings on the subject she did not even know that there was such a beehive of honey and stings to be fallen into  but now i come to mention another curious fact about her  the palace was built on the shores of the loveliest lake in the world and the princess loved this lake more than father or mother  the root of this preference no doubt although the princess did not recognise it as such was that the moment she got into it she recovered the natural right of which she had been so wickedly deprived namely gravity  whether this was owing to the fact that water had been employed as the means of conveying the injury i do not know  but it is certain that she could swim and dive like the duck that her old nurse said she was  the manner in which this alleviation of her misfortune was discovered was as follows  one summer evening during the carnival of the country she had been taken upon the lake by the king and queen in the royal barge  they were accompanied by many of the courtiers in a fleet of little boats in the middle of the lake she wanted to get into the lord chancellor's barge for his daughter who was a great favourite with her was in it with her father  now though the old king rarely condescended to make light of his misfortune yet happening on this occasion to be in a particularly good humour as the barges approached each other he caught up the princess to throw her into the chancellor's barge  he lost his balance however and dropping into the bottom of the barge lost his hold of his daughter not however before imparting to her the downward tendency of his own person though in a somewhat different direction for as the king fell into the boat she fell into the water  with a burst of delighted laughter she disappeared in the lake a cry of horror ascended from the boats  they had never seen the princess go down before  half the men were under water in a moment but they had all one after another come up to the surface again for breath when tinkle tinkle babble and gush came the princess's laugh over the water from far away  there she was swimming like a swan  nor would she come out for king or queen chancellor or daughter  she was perfectly obstinate  but at the same time she seemed more sedate than usual  perhaps that was because a great pleasure spoils laughing  at all events after this the passion of her life was to get into the water and she was always the better behaved and the more beautiful the more she had of it  summer and winter it was quite the same only she could not stay so long in the water when they had to break the ice to let her in  any day from morning till evening in summer she might be descried a streak of white in the blue water lying as still as the shadow of a cloud or shooting along like a dolphin disappearing and coming up again far off just where one did not expect her  she would have been in the lake of a night too if she could have had her way for the balcony of her window overhung a deep pool in it and through a shallow reedy passage she could have swum out into the wide wet water and no one would have been any the wiser  indeed when she happened to wake in the moonlight she could hardly resist the temptation  but there was the sad difficulty of getting into it  she had as great a dread of the air as some children have of the water  for the slightest gust of wind would blow her away and a gust might arise in the stillest moment and if she gave herself a push towards the water and just failed of reaching it her situation would be dreadfully awkward irrespective of the wind for at best there she would have to remain suspended in her nightgown till she was seen and angled for by someone from the window  oh if i had my gravity thought she contemplating the water i would flash off this balcony like a long white sea-bird headlong into the darling wetness  heigh-ho  this was the only consideration that made her wish to be like other people  another reason for her being fond of the water was that in it alone she enjoyed any freedom  for she could not walk out without a cortege consisting in part of a troop of light horse for fear of the liberties which the wind might take with her  and the king grew more apprehensive with increasing years till at last he would not allow her to walk abroad at all without some twenty silken cords fastened to as many parts of her dress and held by twenty noblemen  of course horseback was out of the question  but she bade good-by to all this ceremony when she got into the water  and so remarkable were its effects upon her especially in restoring her for the time to the ordinary human gravity that hum-drum and kopy-keck agreed in recommending the king to bury her alive for three years in the hope that as the water did her so much good the earth would do her yet more  but the king had some vulgar prejudices against the experiment and would not give his consent  foiled in this they yet agreed in another recommendation which seeing that one imported his opinions from china and the other from thibet was very remarkable indeed  they argued that if water of external origin and application could be so efficacious water from a deeper source might work a perfect cure in short that if the poor afflicted princess could by any means be made to cry she might recover her lost gravity  but how was this to be brought about  therein lay all the difficulty to meet which the philosophers were not wise enough  to make the princess cry was as impossible as to make her weigh  they sent for a professional beggar commanded him to prepare his most touching oracle of woe helped him out of the court charade box to whatever he wanted for dressing up and promised great rewards in the event of his success  but it was all in vain  she listened to the mendicant artist's story and gazed at his marvellous make up till she could contain herself no longer and went into the most undignified contortions for relief shrieking positively screeching with laughter  when she had a little recovered herself she ordered her attendants to drive him away and not give him a single copper whereupon his look of mortified discomfiture wrought her punishment and his revenge for it sent her into violent hysterics from which she was with difficulty recovered  but so anxious was the king that the suggestion should have a fair trial that he put himself in a rage one day and rushing up to her room gave her an awful whipping  yet not a tear would flow  she looked grave and her laughing sounded uncommonly like screaming that was all  the good old tyrant though he put on his best gold spectacles to look could not discover the smallest cloud in the serene blue of her eyes    9  put me in again  it must have been about this time that the son of a king who lived a thousand miles from lagobel set out to look for the daughter of a queen  he travelled far and wide but as sure as he found a princess he found some fault in her  of course he could not marry a mere woman however beautiful and there was no princess to be found worthy of him whether the prince was so near perfection that he had a right to demand perfection itself i cannot pretend to say  all i know is that he was a fine handsome brave generous well-bred and well-behaved youth as all princes are  in his wanderings he had come across some reports about our princess but as everybody said she was bewitched he never dreamed that she could bewitch him  for what indeed could a prince do with a princess that had lost her gravity  who could tell what she might not lose next  she might lose her visibility or her tangibility or in short the power of making impressions upon the radical sensorium so that he should never be able to tell whether she was dead or alive  of course he made no further inquiries about her  one day he lost sight of his retinue in a great forest  these forests are very useful in delivering princes from their courtiers like a sieve that keeps back the bran then the princes get away to follow their fortunes  in this way they have the advantage of the princesses who are forced to marry before they have had a bit of fun  i wish our princesses got lost in a forest sometimes  one lovely evening after wandering about for many days he found that he was approaching the outskirts of this forest for the trees had got so thin that he could see the sunset through them and he soon came upon a kind of heath  next he came upon signs of human neighbourhood but by this time it was getting late and there was nobody in the fields to direct him  after travelling for another hour his horse quite worn out with long labour and lack of food fell and was unable to rise again  so he continued his journey on foot  at length he entered another wood not a wild forest but a civilized wood through which a footpath led him to the side of a lake  along this path the prince pursued his way through the gathering darkness  suddenly he paused and listened strange sounds came across the water  it was in fact the princess laughing  now there was something odd in her laugh as i have already hinted for the hatching of a real hearty laugh requires the incubation of gravity and perhaps this was how the prince mistook the laughter for screaming  looking over the lake he saw something white in the water and in an instant he had torn off his tunic kicked off his sandals and plunged in  he soon reached the white object and found that it was a woman  there was not light enough to show that she was a princess but quite enough to show that she was a lady for it does not want much light to see that  now i cannot tell how it came about whether she pretended to be drowning or whether he frightened her or caught her so as to embarrass her but certainly he brought her to shore in a fashion ignominious to a swimmer and more nearly drowned than she had ever expected to be for the water had got into her throat as often as she had tried to speak  at the place to which he bore her the bank was only a foot or two above the water so he gave her a strong lift out of the water to lay her on the bank  but her gravitation ceasing the moment she left the water away she went up into the air scolding and screaming  you naughty naughty naughty naughty man she cried  no one had ever succeeded in putting her into a passion before when the prince saw her ascend he thought he must have been bewitched and have mistaken a great swan for a lady  but the princess caught hold of the topmost cone upon a lofty fir  this came off but she caught at another and in fact stopped herself by gathering cones dropping them as the stalks gave way  the prince meantime stood in the water staring and forgetting to get out  but the princess disappearing he scrambled on shore and went in the direction of the tree  there he found her climbing down one of the branches towards the stem  but in the darkness of the wood the prince continued in some bewilderment as to what the phenomenon could be until reaching the ground and seeing him standing there she caught hold of him and said   i'll tell papa  oh no you won't returned the prince  yes i will she persisted  what business had you to pull me down out of the water and throw me to the bottom of the air  i never did you any harm  pardon me  i did not mean to hurt you  i don't believe you have any brains and that is a worse loss than your wretched gravity  i pity you  the prince now saw that he had come upon the bewitched princess and had already offended her  but before he could think what to say next she burst out angrily giving a stamp with her foot that would have sent her aloft again but for the hold she had of his arm   put me up directly  put you up where you beauty asked the prince  he had fallen in love with her almost already for her anger made her more charming than any one else had ever beheld her and as far as he could see which certainly was not far she had not a single fault about her except of course that she had not any gravity  no prince however would judge of a princess by weight  the loveliness of her foot he would hardly estimate by the depth of the impression it could make in mud  put you up where you beauty asked the prince  in the water you stupid answered the princess  come then said the prince  the condition of her dress increasing her usual difficulty in walking compelled her to cling to him and he could hardly persuade himself that he was not in a delightful dream notwithstanding the torrent of musical abuse with which she overwhelmed him  the prince being therefore in no hurry they came upon the lake at quite another part where the bank was twenty-five feet high at least and when they had reached the edge he turned towards the princess and said   how am i to put you in that is your business she answered quite snappishly  you took me out put me in again  very well said the prince and catching her up in his arms he sprang with her from the rock  the princess had just time to give one delighted shriek of laughter before the water closed over them  when they came to the surface she found that for a moment or two she could not even laugh for she had gone down with such a rush that it was with difficulty she recovered her breath  the instant they reached the surface   how do you like falling in said the prince  after some effort the princess panted out   is that what you call falling in  yes answered the prince i should think it a very tolerable specimen  it seemed to me like going up rejoined she  my feeling was certainly one of elevation too the prince conceded  the princess did not appear to understand him for she retorted his question    how do you like falling in said the princess  beyond everything answered he for i have fallen in with the only perfect creature i ever saw  no more of that  i am tired of it said the princess  perhaps she shared her father's aversion to punning  don't you like falling in then said the prince  it is the most delightful fun i ever had in my life answered she i never fell before  i wish i could learn  to think i am the only person in my father's kingdom that can't fall  here the poor princess looked almost sad  i shall be most happy to fall in with you any time you like said the prince devotedly  thank you  i don't know  perhaps it would not be proper  but i don't care  at all events as we have fallen in let us have a swim together  with all my heart responded the prince  and away they went swimming and diving and floating until at last they heard cries along the shore and saw lights glancing in all directions  it was now quite late and there was no moon  i must go home said the princess  i am very sorry for this is delightful  so am i returned the prince  but i am glad i haven't a home to go to at least i don't exactly know where it is  i wish i hadn't one either rejoined the princess it is so stupid i have a great mind she continued to play them all a trick  why couldn't they leave me alone  they won't trust me in the lake for a single night you see where that green light is burning  that is the window of my room  now if you would just swim there with me very quietly and when we are all but under the balcony give me such a push up you call it-as you did a little while ago i should be able to catch hold of the balcony and get in at the window and then they may look for me till to-morrow morning  with more obedience than pleasure said the prince gallantly and away they swam very gently  will you be in the lake to-morrow night the prince ventured to ask  to be sure i will  i don't think so  perhaps was the princess's somewhat strange answer  but the prince was intelligent enough not to press her further and merely whispered as he gave her the parting lift don't tell  the only answer the princess returned was a roguish look  she was already a yard above his head  the look seemed to say never fear it is too good fun to spoil that way  so perfectly like other people had she been in the water that even yet the prince could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw her ascend slowly grasp the balcony and disappear through the window  he turned almost expecting to see her still by his side  but he was alone in the water  so he swam away quietly and watched the lights roving about the shore for hours after the princess was safe in her chamber  as soon as they disappeared he landed in search of his tunic and sword and after some trouble found them again  then he made the best of his way round the lake to the other side  there the wood was wilder and the shore steeper-rising more immediately towards the mountains which surrounded the lake on all sides and kept sending it messages of silvery streams from morning to night and all night long he soon found a spot whence he could see the green light in the princess's room and where even in the broad daylight he would be in no danger of being discovered from the opposite shore  it was a sort of cave in the rock where he provided himself a bed of withered leaves and lay down too tired for hunger to keep him awake  all night long he dreamed that he was swimming with the princess    10  look at the moon  early the next morning the prince set out to look for something to eat which he soon found at a forester's hut where for many following days he was supplied with all that a brave prince could consider necessary and having plenty to keep him alive for the present he would not think of wants not yet in existence  whenever care intruded this prince always bowed him out in the most princely manner  when he returned from his breakfast to his watch-cave he saw the princess already floating about in the lake attended by the king and queen whom he knew by their crowns and a great company in lovely little boats with canopies of all the colours of the rainbow and flags and streamers of a great many more  it was a very bright day and soon the prince burned up with the heat began to long for the cold water and the cool princess  but he had to endure till twilight for the boats had provisions on board and it was not till the sun went down that the gay party began to vanish  boat after boat drew away to the shore following that of the king and queen till only one apparently the princess's own boat remained  but she did not want to go home even yet and the prince thought he saw her order the boat to the shore without her  at all events it rowed away and now of all the radiant company only one white speck remained  then the prince began to sing and this is what he sung      lady fair   swan-white   lift thine eyes   banish night   by the might   of thine eyes    snowy arms   oars of snow   oar her hither   plashing low   soft and slow   oar her hither    stream behind her   o'er the lake   radiant whiteness   in her wake   following following for her sake   radiant whiteness    cling about her   waters blue   part not from her   but renew   cold and true   kisses round her    lap me round   waters sad   that have left her   make me glad   for ye had   kissed her ere ye left her  before he had finished his song the princess was just under the place where he sat and looking up to find him  her ears had led her truly  would you like a fall princess said the prince looking down  ah there you are  yes if you please prince said the princess looking up  how do you know i am a prince princess said the prince  because you are a very nice young man prince said the princess  come up then princess  fetch me prince  the prince took off his scarf then his sword-belt then his tunic and tied them all together and let them down  but the line was far too short  he unwound his turban and added it to the rest when it was all but long enough and his purse completed it  the princess just managed to lay hold of the knot of money and was beside him in a moment  this rock was much higher than the other and the splash and the dive were tremendous  the princess was in ecstasies of delight and their swim was delicious  night after night they met and swam about in the dark clear lake where such was the prince's gladness that whether the princess's way of looking at things infected him or he was actually getting light-headed he often fancied that he was swimming in the sky instead of the lake  but when he talked about being in heaven the princess laughed at him dreadfully  when the moon came she brought them fresh pleasure  everything looked strange and new in her light with an old withered yet unfading newness  when the moon was nearly full one of their great delights was to dive deep in the water and then turning round look up through it at the great blot of light close above them shimmering and trembling and wavering spreading and contracting seeming to melt away and again grow solid  then they would shoot up through the blot and lo there was the moon far off clear and steady and cold and very lovely at the bottom of a deeper and bluer lake than theirs as the princess said  the prince soon found out that while in the water the princess was very like other people  and besides this she was not so forward in her questions or pert in her replies at sea as on shore  neither did she laugh so much and when she did laugh it was more gently  she seemed altogether more modest and maidenly in the water than out of it  but when the prince who had really fallen in love when he fell in the lake began to talk to her about love she always turned her head towards him and laughed  after a while she began to look puzzled as if she were trying to understand what he meant but could not revealing a notion that he meant something  but as soon as ever she left the lake she was so altered that the prince said to himself if i marry her i see no help for it  we must turn merman and mermaid and go out to sea at once    11  hiss  the princess's pleasure in the lake had grown to a passion and she could scarcely bear to be out of it for an hour  imagine then her consternation when diving with the prince one night a sudden suspicion seized her that the lake was not so deep as it used to be the prince could not imagine what had happened  she shot to the surface and without a word swam at full speed towards the higher side of the lake  he followed begging to know if she was ill or what was the matter  she never turned her head or took the smallest notice of his question  arrived at the shore she coasted the rocks with minute inspection  but she was not able to come to a conclusion for the moon was very small and so she could not see well  she turned therefore and swam home without saying a word to explain her conduct to the prince of whose presence she seemed no longer conscious  he withdrew to his cave in great perplexity and distress  next day she made many observations which alas strengthened her fears  she saw that the banks were too dry and that the grass on the shore and the trailing plants on the rocks were withering away  she caused marks to be made along the borders and examined them day after day in all directions of the wind till at last the horrible idea became a certain fact that the surface of the lake was slowly sinking  the poor princess nearly went out of the little mind she had  it was awful to her to see the lake which she loved more than any living thing lie dying before her eyes  it sank away slowly vanishing  the tops of rocks that had never been seen till now began to appear far down in the clear water  before long they were dry in the sun  it was fearful to think of the mud that would soon lie there baking and festering full of lovely creatures dying and ugly creatures coming to life like the unmaking of a world  and how hot the sun would be without any lake  she could not bear to swim in it any more and began to pine away  her life seemed bound up with it and ever as the lake sank she pined  people said she would not live an hour after the lake was gone  but she never cried  a proclamation was made to all the kingdom that whosoever should discover the cause of the lake's decrease would be rewarded after a princely fashion  hum-drum and kopy-keck applied themselves to their physics and metaphysics but in vain  not even they could suggest a cause  now the fact was that the old princess was at the root of the mischief when she heard that her niece found more pleasure in the water than any one else out of it she went into a rage and cursed herself for her want of foresight  but said she i will soon set all right  the king and the people shall die of thirst their brains shall boil and frizzle in their skulls before i will lose my revenge  and she laughed a ferocious laugh that made the hairs on the back of her black cat stand erect with terror  then she went to an old chest in the room and opening it took out what looked like a piece of dried seaweed  this she threw into a tub of water  then she threw some powder into the water and stirred it with her bare arm muttering over it words of hideous sound and yet more hideous import  then she set the tub aside and took from the chest a huge bunch of a hundred rusty keys that clattered in her shaking hands  then she sat down and proceeded to oil them all before she had finished out from the tub the water of which had kept on a slow motion ever since she had ceased stirring it came the head and half the body of a huge gray snake  but the witch did not look round  it grew out of the tub waving itself backwards and forwards with a slow horizontal motion till it reached the princess when it laid its head upon her shoulder and gave a low hiss in her ear  she started but with joy and seeing the head resting on her shoulder drew it towards her and kissed it  then she drew it all out of the tub and wound it round her body  it was one of those dreadful creatures which few have ever beheld the white snakes of darkness  then she took the keys and went down to her cellar and as she unlocked the door she said to herself   this is worth living for  locking the door behind her she descended a few steps into the cellar and crossing it unlocked another door into a dark narrow passage she locked this also behind her and descended a few more steps  if any one had followed the witch-princess he would have heard her unlock exactly one hundred doors and descend a few steps after unlocking each  when she had unlocked the last she entered a vast cave the roof of which was supported by huge natural pillars of rock  now this roof was the under side of the bottom of the lake  she then untwined the snake from her body and held it by the tail high above her  the hideous creature stretched up its head towards the roof of the cavern which it was just able to reach  it then began to move its head backwards and forwards with a slow oscillating motion as if looking for something  at the same moment the witch began to walk round and round the cavern coming nearer to the centre every circuit while the head of the snake described the same path over the roof that she did over the floor for she kept holding it up  and still it kept slowly oscillating  round and round the cavern they went ever lessening the circuit till at last the snake made a sudden dart and clung to the roof with its mouth  that's right my beauty cried the princess drain it dry  she let it go left it hanging and sat down on a great stone with her black cat which had followed her all round the cave by her side then she began to knit and mutter awful words  the snake hung like a huge leech sucking at the stone the cat stood with his back arched and his tail like a piece of cable looking up at the snake and the old woman sat and knitted and muttered  seven days and seven nights they remained thus when suddenly the serpent dropped from the roof as if exhausted and shrivelled up till it was again like a piece of dried seaweed  the witch started to her feet picked it up put it in her pocket and looked up at the roof  one drop of water was trembling on the spot where the snake had been sucking  as soon as she saw that she turned and fled followed by her cat  shutting the door in a terrible hurry she locked it and having muttered some frightful words sped to the next which also she locked and muttered over and so with all the hundred doors till she arrived in her own cellar then she sat down on the floor ready to faint but listening with malicious delight to the rushing of the water which she could hear distinctly through all the hundred doors  but this was not enough  now that she had tasted revenge she lost her patience  without further measures the lake would be too long in disappearing  so the next night with the last shred of the dying old moon rising she took some of the water in which she had revived the snake put it in a bottle and set out accompanied by her cat  before morning she had made the entire circuit of the lake muttering fearful words as she crossed every stream and casting into it some of the water out of her bottle  when she had finished the circuit she muttered yet again and flung a handful of water towards the moon thereupon every spring in the country ceased to throb and bubble dying away like the pulse of a dying man  the next day there was no sound of falling water to be heard along the borders of the lake  the very courses were dry and the mountains showed no silvery streaks down their dark sides  and not alone had the fountains of mother earth ceased to flow for all the babies throughout the country were crying dreadfully only without tears    12  where is the prince  never since the night when the princess left him so abruptly had the prince had a single interview with her  he had seen her once or twice in the lake but as far as he could discover she had not been in it any more at night  he had sat and sung and looked in vain for his nereid while she like a true nereid was wasting away with her lake sinking as it sank withering as it dried  when at length he discovered the change that was taking place in the level of the water he was in great alarm and perplexity  he could not tell whether the lake was dying because the lady had forsaken it or whether the lady would not come because the lake had begun to sink  but he resolved to know so much at least  he disguised himself and going to the palace requested to see the lord chamberlain  his appearance at once gained his request and the lord chamberlain being a man of some insight perceived that there was more in the prince's solicitation than met the ear  he felt likewise that no one could tell whence a solution of the present difficulties might arise  so he granted the prince's prayer to be made shoeblack to the princess  it was rather cunning in the prince to request such an easy post for the princess could not possibly soil as many shoes as other princesses  he soon learned all that could be told about the princess  he went nearly distracted but after roaming about the lake for days and diving in every depth that remained all that he could do was to put an extra polish on the dainty pair of boots that was never called for  for the princess kept her room with the curtains drawn to shut out the dying lake but she could not shut it out of her mind for a moment  it haunted her imagination so that she felt as if the lake were her soul drying up within her first to mud then to madness and death  she thus brooded over the change with all its dreadful accompaniments till she was nearly distracted  as for the prince she had forgotten him  however much she had enjoyed his company in the water she did not care for him without it  but she seemed to have forgotten her father and mother too  the lake went on sinking  small slimy spots began to appear which glittered steadily amidst the changeful shine of the water  these grew to broad patches of mud which widened and spread with rocks here and there and floundering fishes and crawling eels swarming  the people went everywhere catching these and looking for anything that might have dropped from the royal boats  at length the lake was all but gone only a few of the deepest pools remaining unexhausted  it happened one day that a party of youngsters found themselves on the brink of one of these pools in the very centre of the lake  it was a rocky basin of considerable depth  looking in they saw at the bottom something that shone yellow in the sun  a little boy jumped in and dived for it  it was a plate of gold covered with writing  they carried it to the king  on one side of it stood these words      death alone from death can save   love is death and so is brave    love can fill the deepest grave   love loves on beneath the wave   now this was enigmatical enough to the king and courtiers  but the reverse of the plate explained it a little  its writing amounted to this    if the lake should disappear they must find the hole through which the water ran  but it would be useless to try to stop it by any ordinary means  there was but one effectual mode the body of a living man could alone stanch the flow  the man must give himself of his own will and the lake must take his life as it filled  otherwise the offering would be of no avail  if the nation could not provide one hero it was time it should perish    13  here i am  this was a very disheartening revelation to the king not that he was unwilling to sacrifice a subject but that he was hopeless of finding a man willing to sacrifice himself  no time was to be lost however for the princess was lying motionless on her bed and taking no nourishment but lake-water which was now none of the best  therefore the king caused the contents of the wonderful plate of gold to be published throughout the country  no one however came forward  the prince having gone several days' journey into the forest to consult a hermit whom he had met there on his way to lagobel knew nothing of the oracle till his return  when he had acquainted himself with all the particulars he sat down and thought   she will die if i don't do it and life would be nothing to me without her so i shall lose nothing by doing it  and life will be as pleasant to her as ever for she will soon forget me  and there will be so much more beauty and happiness in the world to be sure i shall not see it  here the poor prince gave a sigh how lovely the lake will be in the moonlight with that glorious creature sporting in it like a wild goddess it is rather hard to be drowned by inches though  let me see that will be seventy inches of me to drown  here he tried to laugh but could not the longer the better however he resumed  for can i not bargain that the princess shall be beside me all the time  so i shall see her once more kiss her perhaps who knows and die looking in her eyes  it will be no death  at least i shall not feel it  and to see the lake filling for the beauty again all right i am ready  he kissed the princess's boot laid it down and hurried to the king's apartment  but feeling as he went that anything sentimental would be disagreeable he resolved to carry off the whole affair with nonchalance  so he knocked at the door of the king's counting-house where it was all but a capital crime to disturb him  when the king heard the knock he started up and opened the door in a rage  seeing only the shoeblack he drew his sword  this i am sorry to say was his usual mode of asserting his regality when he thought his dignity was in danger  but the prince was not in the least alarmed  please your majesty i'm your butler said he  my butler you lying rascal  what do you mean  i mean i will cork your big bottle  is the fellow mad bawled the king raising the point of his sword  i will put a stopper plug what you call it in your leaky lake grand monarch said the prince  the king was in such a rage that before he could speak he had time to cool and to reflect that it would be great waste to kill the only man who was willing to be useful in the present emergency seeing that in the end the insolent fellow would be as dead as if he had died by his majesty's own hand  oh said he at last putting up his sword with difficulty it was so long i am obliged to you you young fool  take a glass of wine  no thank you replied the prince  very well said the king  would you like to run and see your parents before you make your experiment  no thank you said the prince  then we will go and look for the hole at once said his majesty and proceeded to call some attendants  stop please your majesty i have a condition to make interposed the prince  what exclaimed the king a condition and with me  how dare you  as you please returned the prince coolly  i wish your majesty a good morning  you wretch  i will have you put in a sack and stuck in the hole  very well your majesty replied the prince becoming a little more respectful lest the wrath of the king should deprive him of the pleasure of dying for the princess  but what good will that do your majesty  please to remember that the oracle says the victim must offer himself  well you have offered yourself retorted the king  yes upon one condition  condition again roared the king once more drawing his sword begone  somebody else will be glad enough to take the honour off your shoulders  your majesty knows it will not be easy to get another to take my place  well what is your condition growled the king feeling that the prince was right  only this replied the prince  that as i must on no account die before i am fairly drowned and the waiting will be rather wearisome the princess your daughter shall go with me feed me with her own hands and look at me now and then to comfort me for you must confess it is rather hard  as soon as the water is up to my eyes she may go and be happy and forget her poor shoeblack  here the prince's voice faltered and he very nearly grew sentimental in spite of his resolution  why didn't you tell me before what your condition was  such a fuss about nothing exclaimed the king  do you grant it persisted the prince  of course i do replied the king  very well  i am ready  go and have some dinner then while i set my people to find the place  the king ordered out his guards and gave directions to the officers to find the hole in the lake at once  so the bed of the lake was marked out in divisions and thoroughly examined and in an hour or so the hole was discovered  it was in the middle of a stone near the centre of the lake in the very pool where the golden plate had been found  it was a three-cornered hole of no great size  there was water all round the stone but very little was flowing through the hole    14  this is very kind of you  the prince went to dress for the occasion for he was resolved to die like a prince  when the princess heard that a man had offered to die for her she was so transported that she jumped off the bed feeble as she was and danced about the room for joy  she did not care who the man was that was nothing to her  the hole wanted stopping and if only a man would do why take one  in an hour or two more everything was ready  her maid dressed her in haste and they carried her to the side of the lake  when she saw it she shrieked and covered her face with her hands  they bore her across to the stone where they had already placed a little boat for her  the water was not deep enough to float it but they hoped it would be before long  they laid her on cushions placed in the boat wines and fruits and other nice things and stretched a canopy over all  in a few minutes the prince appeared  the princess recognized him at once but did not think it worth while to acknowledge him  here i am said the prince  put me in  they told me it was a shoeblack said the princess  so i am said the prince  i blacked your little boots three times a day because they were all i could get of you  put me in  the courtiers did not resent his bluntness except by saying to each other that he was taking it out in impudence  but how was he to be put in  the golden plate contained no instructions on this point  the prince looked at the hole and saw but one way  he put both his legs into it sitting on the stone and stooping forward covered the corner that remained open with his two hands  in this uncomfortable position he resolved to abide his fate and turning to the people said   now you can go  the king had already gone home to dinner  now you can go repeated the princess after him like a parrot  the people obeyed her and went  presently a little wave flowed over the stone and wetted one of the prince's knees  but he did not mind it much  he began to sing and the song he sang was this      as a world that has no well   darting bright in forest dell   as a world without the gleam   of the downward-going stream   as a world without the glance   of the ocean's fair expanse   as a world where never rain   glittered on the sunny plain    such my heart thy world would be   if no love did flow in thee    as a world without the sound   of the rivulets underground   or the bubbling of the spring   out of darkness wandering   or the mighty rush and flowing   of the river's downward going   or the music-showers that drop   on the outspread beech's top   or the ocean's mighty voice   when his lifted waves rejoice    such my soul thy world would be   if no love did sing in thee    lady keep thy world's delight   keep the waters in thy sight   love hath made me strong to go   for thy sake to realms below   where the water's shine and hum   through the darkness never come   let i pray one thought of me   spring a little well in thee   lest thy loveless soul be found   like a dry and thirsty ground   sing again prince  it makes it less tedious said the princess  but the prince was too much overcome to sing any more and a long pause followed  this is very kind of you prince said the princess at last quite coolly as she lay in the boat with her eyes shut  i am sorry i can't return the compliment thought the prince but you are worth dying for after all  again a wavelet and another and another flowed over the stone and wetted both the prince's knees but he did not speak or move two three four hours passed in this way the princess apparently asleep and the prince very patient  but he was much disappointed in his position for he had none of the consolation he had hoped for  at last he could bear it no longer  princess said he  but at the moment up started the princess crying   i'm afloat  i'm afloat  and the little boat bumped against the stone  princess repeated the prince encouraged by seeing her wide awake and looking eagerly at the water  well said she without looking round  your papa promised that you should look at me and you haven't looked at me once  did he  then i suppose i must  but i am so sleepy  sleep then darling and don't mind me said the poor prince  really you are very good replied the princess  i think i will go to sleep again  just give me a glass of wine and a biscuit first said the prince very humbly  with all my heart said the princess and gaped as she said it  she got the wine and the biscuit however and leaning over the side of the boat towards him was compelled to look at him  why prince she said you don't look well  are you sure you don't mind it not a bit answered he feeling very faint indeed  only i shall die before it is of any use to you unless i have something to eat  there then said she holding out the wine to him  ah you must feed me  i dare not move my hands  the water would run away directly  good gracious said the princess and she began at once to feed him with bits of biscuit and sips of wine  as she fed him he contrived to kiss the tips of her fingers now and then  she did not seem to mind it one way or the other  but the prince felt better  now for your own sake princess said he i cannot let you go to sleep  you must sit and look at me else i shall not be able to keep up  well i will do anything i can to oblige you answered she with condescension and sitting down she did look at him and kept looking at him with wonderful steadiness considering all things  the sun went down and the moon rose and gush after gush the waters were rising up the prince's body  they were up to his waist now  why can't we go and have a swim said the princess  there seems to be water enough just about here  i shall never swim more said the prince  oh i forgot said the princess and was silent  so the water grew and grew and rose up and up on the prince  and the princess sat and looked at him  she fed him now and then  the night wore on  the waters rose and rose  the moon rose likewise higher and higher and shone full on the face of the dying prince  the water was up to his neck  will you kiss me princess said he feebly  the nonchalance was all gone now  yes i will answered the princess and kissed him with a long sweet cold kiss  now said he with a sigh of content i die happy  he did not speak again  the princess gave him some wine for the last time  he was past eating  then she sat down again and looked at him the water rose and rose  it touched his chin  it touched his lower lip  it touched between his lips  he shut them hard to keep it out the princess began to feel strange  it touched his upper lip  he breathed through his nostrils  the princess looked wild  it covered his nostrils  her eyes looked scared and shone strange in the moonlight  his head fell back the water closed over it and the bubbles of his last breath bubbled up through the water  the princess gave a shriek and sprang into the lake  she laid hold first of one leg and then of the other and pulled and tugged but she could not move either  she stopped to take breath and that made her think that he could not get any breath  she was frantic she got hold of him and held his head above the water which was possible now his hands were no longer on the hole  but it was of no use for he was past breathing  love and water brought back all her strength  she got under the water and pulled and pulled with her whole might till at last she got one leg out  the other easily followed  how she got him into the boat she never could tell but when she did she fainted away  coming to herself she seized the oars kept herself steady as best she could and rowed and rowed though she had never rowed before  round rocks and over shallows and through mud she rowed till she got to the landing-stairs of the palace  by this time her people were on the shore for they had heard her shriek  she made them carry the prince to her own room and lay him in her bed and light a fire and send for the doctors  but the lake your highness said the chamberlain who roused by the noise came in in his nightcap  go and drown yourself in it she said  this was the last rudeness of which the princess was ever guilty and one must allow that she had good cause to feel provoked with the lord chamberlain  had it been the king himself he would have fared no better  but both he and the queen were fast asleep  and the chamberlain went back to his bed  somehow the doctors never came  so the princess and her old nurse were left with the prince  but the old nurse was a wise woman and knew what to do  they tried everything for a long time without success  the princess was nearly distracted between hope and fear but she tried on and on one thing after another and everything over and over again  at last when they had all but given it up just as the sun rose the prince opened his eyes    15  look at the rain  the princess burst into a passion of tears and fell on the floor there she lay for an hour and her tears never ceased  all the pent-up crying of her life was spent now  and a rain came on such as had never been seen in that country  the sun shone all the time and the great drops which fell straight to the earth shone likewise  the palace was in the heart of a rainbow  it was a rain of rubies and sapphires and emeralds and topazes  the torrents poured from the mountains like molten gold and if it had not been for its subterraneous outlet the lake would have overflowed and inundated the country  it was full from shore to shore  but the princess did not heed the lake  she lay on the floor and wept and this rain within doors was far more wonderful than the rain out of doors  for when it abated a little and she proceeded to rise she found to her astonishment that she could not  at length after many efforts she succeeded in getting upon her feet  but she tumbled down again directly  hearing her fall her old nurse uttered a yell of delight and ran to her screaming   my darling child she's found her gravity  oh that's it is it said the princess rubbing her shoulder and her knee alternately  i consider it very unpleasant  i feel as if i should be crushed to pieces  hurrah cried the prince from the bed  if you've come round princess so have i  how's the lake  brimful answered the nurse  then we're all happy  that we are indeed answered the princess sobbing  and there was rejoicing all over the country that rainy day  even the babies forgot their past troubles and danced and crowed amazingly and the king told stories and the queen listened to them  and he divided the money in his box and she the honey in her pot among all the children  and there was such jubilation as was never heard of before  of course the prince and princess were betrothed at once  but the princess had to learn to walk before they could be married with any propriety  and this was not so easy at her time of life for she could walk no more than a baby  she was always falling down and hurting herself  is this the gravity you used to make so much of said she one day to the prince as he raised her from the floor  for my part i was a great deal more comfortable without it  no no that's not it  this is it replied the prince as he took her up and carried her about like a baby kissing her all the time this is gravity  that's better said she  i don't mind that so much  and she smiled the sweetest loveliest smile in the prince's face  and she gave him one little kiss in return for all his and he thought them overpaid for he was beside himself with delight  i fear she complained of her gravity more than once after this notwithstanding  it was a long time before she got reconciled to walking  but the pain of learning it was quite counterbalanced by two things either of which would have been sufficient consolation  the first was that the prince himself was her teacher and the second that she could tumble into the lake as often as she pleased  still she preferred to have the prince jump in with her and the splash they made before was nothing to the splash they made now  the lake never sank again  in process of time it wore the roof of the cavern quite through and was twice as deep as before  the only revenge the princess took upon her aunt was to tread pretty hard on her gouty toe the next time she saw her  but she was sorry for it the very next day when she heard that the water had undermined her house and that it had fallen in the night burying her in its ruins whence no one ever ventured to dig up her body  there she lies to this day  so the prince and princess lived and were happy and had crowns of gold and clothes of cloth and shoes of leather and children of boys and girls not one of whom was ever known on the most critical occasion to lose the smallest atom of his or her due proportion of gravity\",\n          \"the wonderful wizard of oz    contents   introduction  chapter i the cyclone  chapter ii the council with the munchkins  chapter iii how dorothy saved the

instinctive love for stories fantastic marvelous and manifestly unreal the winged fairies of grimm and andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations  yet the old time fairy tale having served for generations may now be classed as historical in the children\\u2019s library for the time has come for a series of newer wonder tales in which the stereotyped genie dwarf and fairy are eliminated together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale modern education includes morality therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident  having this thought in mind the story of the wonderful wizard of oz was written solely to please children of today it aspires to being a modernized fairy tale in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out  l frank baum chicago april 1900    the wonderful wizard of oz     chapter i the cyclone   dorothy lived in the midst of the great kansas prairies with uncle henry who was a farmer and aunt em who was the farmer\\u2019s wife their house was small for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles there were four walls a floor and a roof which made one room and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove a cupboard for the dishes a table three or four chairs and the beds uncle henry and aunt em had a big bed in one corner and dorothy a little bed in another corner there was no garret at all and no cellar\\u2014except a small hole dug in the ground called a cyclone cellar where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose mighty enough to crush any building in its path it was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor from which a ladder led down into the small dark hole  when dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions the sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass with little cracks running through it even the grass was not green for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere once the house had been painted but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else  when aunt em came there to live she was a young pretty wife the sun and wind had changed her too they had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips and they were gray also she was thin and gaunt and never smiled now when dorothy who was an orphan first came to her aunt em had been so startled by the child\\u2019s laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever dorothy\\u2019s merry voice reached her ears and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at  uncle henry never laughed he worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was he was gray also from his long beard to his rough boots and he looked stern and solemn and rarely spoke  it was toto that made dorothy laugh and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings toto was not gray he was a little black dog with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny wee nose toto played all day long and dorothy played with him and loved him dearly  today however they were not playing uncle henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky which was even grayer than usual dorothy stood in the door with toto in her arms and looked at the sky too aunt em was washing the dishes  from the far north they heard a low wail of the wind and uncle henry and dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm there now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also  suddenly uncle henry stood up  there\\u2019s a cyclone coming em he called to his wife i\\u2019ll go look after the stock then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept  aunt em dropped her work and came to the door one glance told her of the danger close at hand  quick dorothy she screamed run for the cellar  toto jumped out of dorothy\\u2019s arms and hid under the bed and the girl started to get him aunt em badly frightened threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small dark hole dorothy caught toto at last and started to follow her aunt when she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor  then a strange thing happened  the house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon  the north and south winds met where the house stood and made it the exact center of the cyclone in the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher until it was at the very top of the cyclone and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather  it was very dark and the wind howled horribly around her but dorothy found she was riding quite easily after the first few whirls around and one other time when the house tipped badly she felt as if she were being rocked gently like a baby in a cradle  toto did not like it he ran about the room now here now there barking loudly but dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen  once toto got too near the open trap door and fell in and at first the little girl thought she had lost him but soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall she crept to the hole caught toto by the ear and dragged him into the room again afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen  hour after hour passed away and slowly dorothy got over her fright but she felt quite lonely and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf at first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring at last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed and lay down upon it and toto followed and lay down beside her  in spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep     chapter ii the council with the munchkins   she was awakened by a shock so sudden and severe that if dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt as it was the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened and toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving nor was it dark for the bright sunshine came in at the window flooding the little room she sprang from her bed and with toto at her heels ran and opened the door  the little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw  the cyclone had set the house down very gently\\u2014for a cyclone\\u2014in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty there were lovely patches of greensward all about with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes a little way off was a small brook rushing and sparkling along between green banks and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry gray prairies  while she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen they were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to but neither were they very small in fact they seemed about as tall as dorothy who was a well-grown child for her age although they were so far as looks go many years older  three were men and one a woman and all were oddly dressed they wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved the hats of the men were blue the little woman\\u2019s hat was white and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds the men were dressed in blue of the same shade as their hats and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops the men dorothy thought were about as old as uncle henry for two of them had beards but the little woman was doubtless much older her face was covered with wrinkles her hair was nearly white and she walked rather stiffly  when these people drew near the house where dorothy was standing in the doorway they paused and whispered among themselves as if afraid to come farther but the little old woman walked up to dorothy made a low bow and said in a sweet voice   you are welcome most noble sorceress to the land of the munchkins we are so grateful to you for having killed the wicked witch of the east and for setting our people free from bondage  dorothy listened to this speech with wonder what could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress and saying she had killed the wicked witch of the east dorothy was an innocent harmless little girl who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home and she had never killed anything in all her life  but the little woman evidently expected her to answer so dorothy said with hesitation you are very kind but there must be some mistake i have not killed anything  your house did anyway replied the little old woman with a laugh and that is the same thing see she continued pointing to the corner of the house there are her two feet still sticking out from under a block of wood  dorothy looked and gave a little cry of fright there indeed just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on two feet were sticking out shod in silver shoes with pointed toes  oh dear oh dear cried dorothy clasping her hands together in dismay the house must have fallen on her whatever shall we do  there is nothing to be done said the little woman calmly  but who was she asked dorothy  she was the wicked witch of the east as i said answered the little woman she has held all the munchkins in bondage for many years making them slave for her night and day now they are all set free and are grateful to you for the favor  who are the munchkins inquired dorothy  they are the people who live in this land of the east where the wicked witch ruled  are you a munchkin asked dorothy  no but i am their friend although i live in the land of the north when they saw the witch of the east was dead the munchkins sent a swift messenger to me and i came at once i am the witch of the north  oh gracious cried dorothy are you a real witch  yes indeed answered the little woman but i am a good witch and the people love me i am not as powerful as the wicked witch was who ruled here or i should have set the people free myself  but i thought all witches were wicked said the girl who was half frightened at facing a real witch  oh no that is a great mistake there were only four witches in all the land of oz and two of them those who live in the north and the south are good witches i know this is true for i am one of them myself and cannot be mistaken those who dwelt in the east and the west were indeed wicked witches but now that you have killed one of them there is but one wicked witch in all the land of oz\\u2014the one who lives in the west  but said dorothy after a moment\\u2019s thought aunt em has told me that the witches were all dead\\u2014years and years ago  who is aunt em inquired the little old woman  she is my aunt who lives in kansas where i came from  the witch of the north seemed to think for a time with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground then she looked up and said i do not know where kansas is for i have never heard that country mentioned before but tell me is it a civilized country  oh yes replied dorothy  then that accounts for it in the civilized countries i believe there are no witches left nor wizards nor sorceresses nor magicians but you see the land of oz has never been civilized for we are cut off from all the rest of the world therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us  who are the wizards asked dorothy  oz himself is the great wizard answered the witch sinking her voice to a whisper he is more powerful than all the rest of us together he lives in the city of emeralds  dorothy was going to ask another question but just then the munchkins who had been standing silently by gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the wicked witch had been lying  what is it asked the little old woman and looked and began to laugh the feet of the dead witch had disappeared entirely and nothing was left but the silver shoes  she was so old explained the witch of the north that she dried up quickly in the sun that is the end of her but the silver shoes are yours and you shall have them to wear she reached down and picked up the shoes and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to dorothy  the witch of the east was proud of those silver shoes said one of the munchkins and there is some charm connected with them but what it is we never knew  dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table then she came out again to the munchkins and said   i am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle for i am sure they will worry about me can you help me find my way  the munchkins and the witch first looked at one another and then at dorothy and then shook their heads  at the east not far from here said one there is a great desert and none could live to cross it  it is the same at the south said another for i have been there and seen it the south is the country of the quadlings  i am told said the third man that it is the same at the west and that country where the winkies live is ruled by the wicked witch of the west who would make you her slave if you passed her way  the north is my home said the old lady and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this land of oz i\\u2019m afraid my dear you will have to live with us  dorothy began to sob at this for she felt lonely among all these strange people her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted munchkins for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also as for the little old woman she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose while she counted one two three in a solemn voice at once the cap changed to a slate on which was written in big white chalk marks   let dorothy go to the city of emeralds   the little old woman took the slate from her nose and having read the words on it asked is your name dorothy my dear  yes answered the child looking up and drying her tears  then you must go to the city of emeralds perhaps oz will help you  where is this city asked dorothy  it is exactly in the center of the country and is ruled by oz the great wizard i told you of  is he a good man inquired the girl anxiously  he is a good wizard whether he is a man or not i cannot tell for i have never seen him  how can i get there asked dorothy  you must walk it is a long journey through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible however i will use all the magic arts i know of to keep you from harm  won\\u2019t you go with me pleaded the girl who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend  no i cannot do that she replied but i will give you my kiss and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the witch of the north  she came close to dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead where her lips touched the girl they left a round shining mark as dorothy found out soon after  the road to the city of emeralds is paved with yellow brick said the witch so you cannot miss it when you get to oz do not be afraid of him but tell your story and ask him to help you good-bye my dear  the three munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey after which they walked away through the trees the witch gave dorothy a friendly little nod whirled around on her left heel three times and straightway disappeared much to the surprise of little toto who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by  but dorothy knowing her to be a witch had expected her to disappear in just that way and was not surprised in the least     chapter iii how dorothy saved the scarecrow   when dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry so she went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread which she spread with butter she gave some to toto and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear sparkling water toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there dorothy went to get him and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast  then she went back to the house and having helped herself and toto to a good drink of the cool clear water she set about making ready for the journey to the city of emeralds  dorothy had only one other dress but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed it was gingham with checks of white and blue and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings it was still a pretty frock the girl washed herself carefully dressed herself in the clean gingham and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head she took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard laying a white cloth over the top then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were  they surely will never do for a long journey toto she said and toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant  at that moment dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the witch of the east  i wonder if they will fit me she said to toto they would be just the thing to take a long walk in for they could not wear out  she took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her  finally she picked up her basket  come along toto she said we will go to the emerald city and ask the great oz how to get back to kansas again  she closed the door locked it and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress and so with toto trotting along soberly behind her she started on her journey  there were several roads nearby but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow bricks within a short time she was walking briskly toward the emerald city her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard yellow road-bed the sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly and dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land  she was surprised as she walked along to see how pretty the country was about her there were neat fences at the sides of the road painted a dainty blue color and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance evidently the munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops once in a while she would pass a house and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the wicked witch and setting them free from bondage the houses of the munchkins were odd-looking dwellings for each was round with a big dome for a roof all were painted blue for in this country of the east blue was the favorite color  toward evening when dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night she came to a house rather larger than the rest on the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible and the people were laughing and singing while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts pies and cakes and many other good things to eat  the people greeted dorothy kindly and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them for this was the home of one of the richest munchkins in the land and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the wicked witch  dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich munchkin himself whose name was boq then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance  when boq saw her silver shoes he said you must be a great sorceress  why asked the girl  because you wear silver shoes and have killed the wicked witch besides you have white in your frock and only witches and sorceresses wear white  my dress is blue and white checked said dorothy smoothing out the wrinkles in it  it is kind of you to wear that said boq blue is the color of the munchkins and white is the witch color so we know you are a friendly witch  dorothy did not know what to say to this for all the people seemed to think her a witch and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land  when she had tired watching the dancing boq led her into the house where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it the sheets were made of blue cloth and dorothy slept soundly in them till morning with toto curled up on the blue rug beside her  she ate a hearty breakfast and watched a wee munchkin baby who played with toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused dorothy toto was a fine curiosity to all the people for they had never seen a dog before  how far is it to the emerald city the girl asked  i do not know answered boq gravely for i have never been there it is better for people to keep away from oz unless they have business with him but it is a long way to the emerald city and it will take you many days the country here is rich and pleasant but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey  this worried dorothy a little but she knew that only the great oz could help her get to kansas again so she bravely resolved not to turn back  she bade her friends good-bye and again started along the road of yellow brick when she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down there was a great cornfield beyond the fence and not far away she saw a scarecrow placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn  dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the scarecrow its head was a small sack stuffed with straw with eyes nose and mouth painted on it to represent a face an old pointed blue hat that had belonged to some munchkin was perched on his head and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes worn and faded which had also been stuffed with straw on the feet were some old boots with blue tops such as every man wore in this country and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back  while dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer painted face of the scarecrow she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her she thought she must have been mistaken at first for none of the scarecrows in kansas ever wink but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it while toto ran around the pole and barked  good day said the scarecrow in a rather husky voice  did you speak asked the girl in wonder  certainly answered the scarecrow how do you do  i\\u2019m pretty well thank you replied dorothy politely how do you do  i\\u2019m not feeling well said the scarecrow with a smile for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows  can\\u2019t you get down asked dorothy  no for this pole is stuck up my back if you will please take away the pole i shall be greatly obliged to you  dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole for being stuffed with straw it was quite light  thank you very much said the scarecrow when he had been set down on the ground i feel like a new man  dorothy was puzzled at this for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak and to see him bow and walk along beside her  who are you asked the scarecrow when he had stretched himself and yawned and where are you going  my name is dorothy said the girl and i am going to the emerald city to ask the great oz to send me back to kansas  where is the emerald city he inquired and who is oz  why don\\u2019t you know she returned in surprise  no indeed i don\\u2019t know anything you see i am stuffed so i have no brains at all he answered sadly  oh said dorothy i\\u2019m awfully sorry for you  do you think he asked if i go to the emerald city with you that oz would give me some brains  i cannot tell she returned but you may come with me if you like if oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now  that is true said the scarecrow you see he continued confidentially i don\\u2019t mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed because i cannot get hurt if anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me it doesn\\u2019t matter for i can\\u2019t feel it but i do not want people to call me a fool and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains as yours is how am i ever to know anything  i understand how you feel said the little girl who was truly sorry for him if you will come with me i\\u2019ll ask oz to do all he can for you  thank you he answered gratefully  they walked back to the road dorothy helped him over the fence and they started along the path of yellow brick for the emerald city  toto did not like this addition to the party at first he smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the scarecrow  don\\u2019t mind toto said dorothy to her new friend he never bites  oh i\\u2019m not afraid replied the scarecrow he can\\u2019t hurt the straw do let me carry that basket for you i shall not mind it for i can\\u2019t get tired i\\u2019ll tell you a secret he continued as he walked along there is only one thing in the world i am afraid of  what is that asked dorothy the munchkin farmer who made you  no answered the scarecrow it\\u2019s a lighted match     chapter iv the road through the forest   after a few hours the road began to be rough and the walking grew so difficult that the scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks which were here very uneven sometimes indeed they were broken or missing altogether leaving holes that toto jumped across and dorothy walked around as for the scarecrow having no brains he walked straight ahead and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks it never hurt him however and dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap  the farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back there were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became  at noon they sat down by the roadside near a little brook and dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread she offered a piece to the scarecrow but he refused  i am never hungry he said and it is a lucky thing i am not for my mouth is only painted and if i should cut a hole in it so i could eat the straw i am stuffed with would come out and that would spoil the shape of my head  dorothy saw at once that this was true so she only nodded and went on eating her bread  tell me something about yourself and the country you came from said the scarecrow when she had finished her dinner so she told him all about kansas and how gray everything was there and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer land of oz  the scarecrow listened carefully and said i cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry gray place you call kansas  that is because you have no brains answered the girl no matter how dreary and gray our homes are we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country be it ever so beautiful there is no place like home  the scarecrow sighed  of course i cannot understand it he said if your heads were stuffed with straw like mine you would probably all live in the beautiful places and then kansas would have no people at all it is fortunate for kansas that you have brains  won\\u2019t you tell me a story while we are resting asked the child  the scarecrow looked at her reproachfully and answered   my life has been so short that i really know nothing whatever i was only made day before yesterday what happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me luckily when the farmer made my head one of the first things he did was to paint my ears so that i heard what was going on there was another munchkin with him and the first thing i heard was the farmer saying \\u2018how do you like those ears\\u2019  \\u2018they aren\\u2019t straight\\u2019 answered the other  \\u2018never mind\\u2019 said the farmer \\u2018they are ears just the same\\u2019 which was true enough  \\u2018now i\\u2019ll make the eyes\\u2019 said the farmer so he painted my right eye and as soon as it was finished i found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity for this was my first glimpse of the world  \\u2018that\\u2019s a rather pretty eye\\u2019 remarked the munchkin who was watching the farmer \\u2018blue paint is just the color for eyes\\u2019  \\u2018i think i\\u2019ll make the other a little bigger\\u2019 said the farmer and when the second eye was done i could see much better than before then he made my nose and my mouth but i did not speak because at that time i didn\\u2019t know what a mouth was for i had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs and when they fastened on my head at last i felt very proud for i thought i was just as good a man as anyone  \\u2018this fellow will scare the crows fast enough\\u2019 said the farmer \\u2018he looks just like a man\\u2019  \\u2018why he is a man\\u2019 said the other and i quite agreed with him the farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield and set me up on a tall stick where you found me he and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone  i did not like to be deserted this way so i tried to walk after them but my feet would not touch the ground and i was forced to stay on that pole it was a lonely life to lead for i had nothing to think of having been made such a little while before many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield but as soon as they saw me they flew away again thinking i was a munchkin and this pleased me and made me feel that i was quite an important person by and by an old crow flew near me and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said   \\u2018i wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw\\u2019 then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted the other birds seeing he was not harmed by me came to eat the corn too so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me  i felt sad at this for it showed i was not such a good scarecrow after all but the old crow comforted me saying \\u2018if you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them and a better man than some of them brains are the only things worth having in this world no matter whether one is a crow or a man\\u2019  after the crows had gone i thought this over and decided i would try hard to get some brains by good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake and from what you say i am sure the great oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the emerald city  i hope so said dorothy earnestly since you seem anxious to have them  oh yes i am anxious returned the scarecrow it is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool  well said the girl let us go and she handed the basket to the scarecrow  there were no fences at all by the roadside now and the land was rough and untilled toward evening they came to a great forest where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick it was almost dark under the trees for the branches shut out the daylight but the travelers did not stop and went on into the forest  if this road goes in it must come out said the scarecrow and as the emerald city is at the other end of the road we must go wherever it leads us  anyone would know that said dorothy  certainly that is why i know it returned the scarecrow if it required brains to figure it out i never should have said it  after an hour or so the light faded away and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness dorothy could not see at all but toto could for some dogs see very well in the dark and the scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day so she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well  if you see any house or any place where we can pass the night she said you must tell me for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark  soon after the scarecrow stopped  i see a little cottage at the right of us he said built of logs and branches shall we go there  yes indeed answered the child i am all tired out  so the scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage and dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner she lay down at once and with toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep the scarecrow who was never tired stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came     chapter v the rescue of the tin woodman   when dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and toto had long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels she sat up and looked around her there was the scarecrow still standing patiently in his corner waiting for her  we must go and search for water she said to him  why do you want water he asked  to wash my face clean after the dust of the road and to drink so the dry bread will not stick in my throat  it must be inconvenient to be made of flesh said the scarecrow thoughtfully for you must sleep and eat and drink however you have brains and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly  they left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water where dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast she saw there was not much bread left in the basket and the girl was thankful the scarecrow did not have to eat anything for there was scarcely enough for herself and toto for the day  when she had finished her meal and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick she was startled to hear a deep groan near by  what was that she asked timidly  i cannot imagine replied the scarecrow but we can go and see  just then another groan reached their ears and the sound seemed to come from behind them they turned and walked through the forest a few steps when dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees she ran to the place and then stopped short with a little cry of surprise  one of the big trees had been partly chopped through and standing beside it with an uplifted axe in his hands was a man made entirely of tin his head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body but he stood perfectly motionless as if he could not stir at all  dorothy looked at him in amazement and so did the scarecrow while toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs which hurt his teeth  did you groan asked dorothy  yes answered the tin man i did i\\u2019ve been groaning for more than a year and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me  what can i do for you she inquired softly for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke  get an oil-can and oil my joints he answered they are rusted so badly that i cannot move them at all if i am well oiled i shall soon be all right again you will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage  dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can and then she returned and asked anxiously where are your joints  oil my neck first replied the tin woodman so she oiled it and as it was quite badly rusted the scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely and then the man could turn it himself  now oil the joints in my arms he said and dorothy oiled them and the scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new  the tin woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe which he leaned against the tree  this is a great comfort he said i have been holding that axe in the air ever since i rusted and i\\u2019m glad to be able to put it down at last now if you will oil the joints of my legs i shall be all right once more  so they oiled his legs until he could move them freely and he thanked them again and again for his release for he seemed a very polite creature and very grateful  i might have stood there always if you had not come along he said so you have certainly saved my life how did you happen to be here  we are on our way to the emerald city to see the great oz she answered and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night  why do you wish to see oz he asked  i want him to send me back to kansas and the scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head she replied  the tin woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment then he said   do you suppose oz could give me a heart  why i guess so dorothy answered it would be as easy as to give the scarecrow brains  true the tin woodman returned so if you will allow me to join your party i will also go to the emerald city and ask oz to help me  come along said the scarecrow heartily and dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company so the tin woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick  the tin woodman had asked dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket for he said if i should get caught in the rain and rust again i would need the oil-can badly  it was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass but the tin woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party  dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again  why didn\\u2019t you walk around the hole asked the tin woodman  i don\\u2019t know enough replied the scarecrow cheerfully my head is stuffed with straw you know and that is why i am going to oz to ask him for some brains  oh i see said the tin woodman but after all brains are not the best things in the world  have you any inquired the scarecrow  no my head is quite empty answered the woodman but once i had brains and a heart also so having tried them both i should much rather have a heart  and why is that asked the scarecrow  i will tell you my story and then you will know  so while they were walking through the forest the tin woodman told the following story   i was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living when i grew up i too became a wood-chopper and after my father died i took care of my old mother as long as she lived then i made up my mind that instead of living alone i would marry so that i might not become lonely  there was one of the munchkin girls who was so beautiful that i soon grew to love her with all my heart she on her part promised to marry me as soon as i could earn enough money to build a better house for her so i set to work harder than ever but the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework so the old woman went to the wicked witch of the east and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage thereupon the wicked witch enchanted my axe and when i was chopping away at my best one day for i was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg  this at first seemed a great misfortune for i knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper so i went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin the leg worked very well once i was used to it but my action angered the wicked witch of the east for she had promised the old woman i should not marry the pretty munchkin girl when i began chopping again my axe slipped and cut off my right leg again i went to the tinsmith and again he made me a leg out of tin after this the enchanted axe cut off my arms one after the other but nothing daunted i had them replaced with tin ones the wicked witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head and at first i thought that was the end of me but the tinsmith happened to come along and he made me a new head out of tin  i thought i had beaten the wicked witch then and i worked harder than ever but i little knew how cruel my enemy could be she thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful munchkin maiden and made my axe slip again so that it cut right through my body splitting me into two halves once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it by means of joints so that i could move around as well as ever but alas i had now no heart so that i lost all my love for the munchkin girl and did not care whether i married her or not i suppose she is still living with the old woman waiting for me to come after her  my body shone so brightly in the sun that i felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped for it could not cut me there was only one danger\\u2014that my joints would rust but i kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever i needed it however there came a day when i forgot to do this and being caught in a rainstorm before i thought of the danger my joints had rusted and i was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me it was a terrible thing to undergo but during the year i stood there i had time to think that the greatest loss i had known was the loss of my heart while i was in love i was the happiest man on earth but no one can love who has not a heart and so i am resolved to ask oz to give me one if he does i will go back to the munchkin maiden and marry her  both dorothy and the scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the tin woodman and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart  all the same said the scarecrow i shall ask for brains instead of a heart for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one  i shall take the heart returned the tin woodman for brains do not make one happy and happiness is the best thing in the world  dorothy did not say anything for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right and she decided if she could only get back to kansas and aunt em it did not matter so much whether the woodman had no brains and the scarecrow no heart or each got what he wanted  what worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone and another meal for herself and toto would empty the basket to be sure neither the woodman nor the scarecrow ever ate anything but she was not made of tin nor straw and could not live unless she was fed     chapter vi the cowardly lion   all this time dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods the road was still paved with yellow brick but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees and the walking was not at all good  there were few birds in this part of the forest for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine but now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees these sounds made the little girl\\u2019s heart beat fast for she did not know what made them but toto knew and he walked close to dorothy\\u2019s side and did not even bark in return  how long will it be the child asked of the tin woodman before we are out of the forest  i cannot tell was the answer for i have never been to the emerald city but my father went there once when i was a boy and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country although nearer to the city where oz dwells the country is beautiful but i am not afraid so long as i have my oil-can and nothing can hurt the scarecrow while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the good witch\\u2019s kiss and that will protect you from harm  but toto said the girl anxiously what will protect him  we must protect him ourselves if he is in danger replied the tin woodman  just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar and the next moment a great lion bounded into the road with one blow of his paw he sent the scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road and then he struck at the tin woodman with his sharp claws but to the lion\\u2019s surprise he could make no impression on the tin although the woodman fell over in the road and lay still  little toto now that he had an enemy to face ran barking toward the lion and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog when dorothy fearing toto would be killed and heedless of danger rushed forward and slapped the lion upon his nose as hard as she could while she cried out   don\\u2019t you dare to bite toto you ought to be ashamed of yourself a big beast like you to bite a poor little dog  i didn\\u2019t bite him said the lion as he rubbed his nose with his paw where dorothy had hit it  no but you tried to she retorted you are nothing but a big coward  i know it said the lion hanging his head in shame i\\u2019ve always known it but how can i help it  i don\\u2019t know i\\u2019m sure to think of your striking a stuffed man like the poor scarecrow  is he stuffed asked the lion in surprise as he watched her pick up the scarecrow and set him upon his feet while she patted him into shape again  of course he\\u2019s stuffed replied dorothy who was still angry  that\\u2019s why he went over so easily remarked the lion it astonished me to see him whirl around so is the other one stuffed also  no said dorothy he\\u2019s made of tin and she helped the woodman up again  that\\u2019s why he nearly blunted my claws said the lion when they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back what is that little animal you are so tender of  he is my dog toto answered dorothy  is he made of tin or stuffed asked the lion  neither he\\u2019s a\\u2014a\\u2014a meat dog said the girl  oh he\\u2019s a curious animal and seems remarkably small now that i look at him no one would think of biting such a little thing except a coward like me continued the lion sadly  what makes you a coward asked dorothy looking at the great beast in wonder for he was as big as a small horse  it\\u2019s a mystery replied the lion i suppose i was born that way all the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave for the lion is everywhere thought to be the king of beasts i learned that if i roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way whenever i\\u2019ve met a man i\\u2019ve been awfully scared but i just roared at him and he has always run away as fast as he could go if the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me i should have run myself\\u2014i\\u2019m such a coward but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me and of course i let them go  but that isn\\u2019t right the king of beasts shouldn\\u2019t be a coward said the scarecrow  i know it returned the lion wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail it is my great sorrow and makes my life very unhappy but whenever there is danger my heart begins to beat fast  perhaps you have heart disease said the tin woodman  it may be said the lion  if you have continued the tin woodman you ought to be glad for it proves you have a heart for my part i have no heart so i cannot have heart disease  perhaps said the lion thoughtfully if i had no heart i should not be a coward  have you brains asked the scarecrow  i suppose so i\\u2019ve never looked to see replied the lion  i am going to the great oz to ask him to give me some remarked the scarecrow for my head is stuffed with straw  and i am going to ask him to give me a heart said the woodman  and i am going to ask him to send toto and me back to kansas added dorothy  do you think oz could give me courage asked the cowardly lion  just as easily as he could give me brains said the scarecrow  or give me a heart said the tin woodman  or send me back to kansas said dorothy  then if you don\\u2019t mind i\\u2019ll go with you said the lion for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage  you will be very welcome answered dorothy for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts it seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily  they really are said the lion but that doesn\\u2019t make me any braver and as long as i know myself to be a coward i shall be unhappy  so once more the little company set off upon the journey the lion walking with stately strides at dorothy\\u2019s side toto did not approve of this new comrade at first for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the lion\\u2019s great jaws but after a time he became more at ease and presently toto and the cowardly lion had grown to be good friends  during the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey once indeed the tin woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road and killed the poor little thing this made the tin woodman very unhappy for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret these tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw and there they rusted when dorothy presently asked him a question the tin woodman could not open his mouth for his jaws were tightly rusted together he became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to dorothy to relieve him but she could not understand the lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong but the scarecrow seized the oil-can from dorothy\\u2019s basket and oiled the woodman\\u2019s jaws so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before  this will serve me a lesson said he to look where i step for if i should kill another bug or beetle i should surely cry again and crying rusts my jaws so that i cannot speak  thereafter he walked very carefully with his eyes on the road and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it so as not to harm it the tin woodman knew very well he had no heart and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything  you people with hearts he said have something to guide you and need never do wrong but i have no heart and so i must be very careful when oz gives me a heart of course i needn\\u2019t mind so much     chapter vii the journey to the great oz   they were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest for there were no houses near the tree made a good thick covering to protect them from the dew and the tin woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely she and toto ate the last of their bread and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast  if you wish said the lion i will go into the forest and kill a deer for you you can roast it by the fire since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food and then you will have a very good breakfast  don\\u2019t please don\\u2019t begged the tin woodman i should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer and then my jaws would rust again  but the lion went away into the forest and found his own supper and no one ever knew what it was for he didn\\u2019t mention it and the scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled dorothy\\u2019s basket with them so that she would not be hungry for a long time she thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the scarecrow but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts his padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket but the scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket for it enabled him to keep away from the fire as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up so he kept a good distance away from the flames and only came near to cover dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep these kept her very snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning  when it was daylight the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook and soon after they all started toward the emerald city  this was to be an eventful day for the travelers they had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side it was a very wide ditch and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep and there were many big jagged rocks at the bottom the sides were so steep that none of them could climb down and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end  what shall we do asked dorothy despairingly  i haven\\u2019t the faintest idea said the tin woodman and the lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful  but the scarecrow said we cannot fly that is certain neither can we climb down into this great ditch therefore if we cannot jump over it we must stop where we are  i think i could jump over it said the cowardly lion after measuring the distance carefully in his mind  then we are all right answered the scarecrow for you can carry us all over on your back one at a time  well i\\u2019ll try it said the lion who will go first  i will declared the scarecrow for if you found that you could not jump over the gulf dorothy would be killed or the tin woodman badly dented on the rocks below but if i am on your back it will not matter so much for the fall would not hurt me at all  i am terribly afraid of falling myself said the cowardly lion but i suppose there is nothing to do but try it so get on my back and we will make the attempt  the scarecrow sat upon the lion\\u2019s back and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down  why don\\u2019t you run and jump asked the scarecrow  because that isn\\u2019t the way we lions do these things he replied then giving a great spring he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side they were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it and after the scarecrow had got down from his back the lion sprang across the ditch again  dorothy thought she would go next so she took toto in her arms and climbed on the lion\\u2019s back holding tightly to his mane with one hand the next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air and then before she had time to think about it she was safe on the other side the lion went back a third time and got the tin woodman and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest for his great leaps had made his breath short and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long  they found the forest very thick on this side and it looked dark and gloomy after the lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick silently wondering each in his own mind if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again to add to their discomfort they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest and the lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the kalidahs lived  what are the kalidahs asked the girl  they are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers replied the lion and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as i could kill toto i\\u2019m terribly afraid of the kalidahs  i\\u2019m not surprised that you are returned dorothy they must be dreadful beasts  the lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road but this one was so broad and deep that the lion knew at once he could not leap across it  so they sat down to consider what they should do and after serious thought the scarecrow said   here is a great tree standing close to the ditch if the tin woodman can chop it down so that it will fall to the other side we can walk across it easily  that is a first-rate idea said the lion one would almost suspect you had brains in your head instead of straw  the woodman set to work at once and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through then the lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch with its top branches on the other side  they had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers  they are the kalidahs said the cowardly lion beginning to tremble  quick cried the scarecrow let us cross over  so dorothy went first holding toto in her arms the tin woodman followed and the scarecrow came next the lion although he was certainly afraid turned to face the kalidahs and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that dorothy screamed and the scarecrow fell over backward while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise  but seeing they were bigger than the lion and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him the kalidahs again rushed forward and the lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree and the lion said to dorothy   we are lost for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws but stand close behind me and i will fight them as long as i am alive  wait a minute called the scarecrow he had been thinking what was best to be done and now he asked the woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch the tin woodman began to use his axe at once and just as the two kalidahs were nearly across the tree fell with a crash into the gulf carrying the ugly snarling brutes with it and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom  well said the cowardly lion drawing a long breath of relief i see we are going to live a little while longer and i am glad of it for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet  ah said the tin woodman sadly i wish i had a heart to beat  this adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest and they walked so fast that dorothy became tired and had to ride on the lion\\u2019s back to their great joy the trees became thinner the farther they advanced and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river flowing swiftly just before them on the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits they were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them  how shall we cross the river asked dorothy  that is easily done replied the scarecrow the tin woodman must build us a raft so we can float to the other side  so the woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft and while he was busy at this the scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit this pleased dorothy who had eaten nothing but nuts all day and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit  but it takes time to make a raft even when one is as industrious and untiring as the tin woodman and when night came the work was not done so they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning and dorothy dreamed of the emerald city and of the good wizard oz who would soon send her back to her own home again     chapter viii the deadly poppy field   our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope and dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through although they had suffered many discouragements but before them was a lovely sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the emerald city  to be sure the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land but the raft was nearly done and after the tin woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins they were ready to start dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held toto in her arms when the cowardly lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly for he was big and heavy but the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood upon the other end to steady it and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water  they got along quite well at first but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick and the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom  this is bad said the tin woodman for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the wicked witch of the west and she will enchant us and make us her slaves  and then i should get no brains said the scarecrow  and i should get no courage said the cowardly lion  and i should get no heart said the tin woodman  and i should never get back to kansas said dorothy  we must certainly get to the emerald city if we can the scarecrow continued and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river then before he could pull it out again\\u2014or let go\\u2014the raft was swept away and the poor scarecrow was left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river  good-bye he called after them and they were very sorry to leave him indeed the tin woodman began to cry but fortunately remembered that he might rust and so dried his tears on dorothy\\u2019s apron  of course this was a bad thing for the scarecrow  i am now worse off than when i first met dorothy he thought then i was stuck on a pole in a cornfield where i could make-believe scare the crows at any rate but surely there is no use for a scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river i am afraid i shall never have any brains after all  down the stream the raft floated and the poor scarecrow was left far behind then the lion said   something must be done to save us i think i can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail  so he sprang into the water and the tin woodman caught fast hold of his tail then the lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore it was hard work although he was so big but by and by they were drawn out of the current and then dorothy took the tin woodman\\u2019s long pole and helped push the raft to the land  they were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the emerald city  what shall we do now asked the tin woodman as the lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him  we must get back to the road in some way said dorothy  the best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again remarked the lion  so when they were rested dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank to the road from which the river had carried them it was a lovely country with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them and had they not felt so sorry for the poor scarecrow they could have been very happy  they walked along as fast as they could dorothy only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower and after a time the tin woodman cried out  look  then they all looked at the river and saw the scarecrow perched upon his pole in the middle of the water looking very lonely and sad  what can we do to save him asked dorothy  the lion and the woodman both shook their heads for they did not know so they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the scarecrow until a stork flew by who upon seeing them stopped to rest at the water\\u2019s edge  who are you and where are you going asked the stork  i am dorothy answered the girl and these are my friends the tin woodman and the cowardly lion and we are going to the emerald city  this isn\\u2019t the road said the stork as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party  i know it returned dorothy but we have lost the scarecrow and are wondering how we shall get him again  where is he asked the stork  over there in the river answered the little girl  if he wasn\\u2019t so big and heavy i would get him for you remarked the stork  he isn\\u2019t heavy a bit said dorothy eagerly for he is stuffed with straw and if you will bring him back to us we shall thank you ever and ever so much  well i\\u2019ll try said the stork but if i find he is too heavy to carry i shall have to drop him in the river again  so the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the scarecrow was perched upon his pole then the stork with her great claws grabbed the scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank where dorothy and the lion and the tin woodman and toto were sitting  when the scarecrow found himself among his friends again he was so happy that he hugged them all even the lion and toto and as they walked along he sang tol-de-ri-de-oh at every step he felt so gay  i was afraid i should have to stay in the river forever he said but the kind stork saved me and if i ever get any brains i shall find the stork again and do her some kindness in return  that\\u2019s all right said the stork who was flying along beside them i always like to help anyone in trouble but i must go now for my babies are waiting in the nest for me i hope you will find the emerald city and that oz will help you  thank you replied dorothy and then the kind stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight  they walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them there were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms besides great clusters of scarlet poppies which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled dorothy\\u2019s eyes  aren\\u2019t they beautiful the girl asked as she breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers  i suppose so answered the scarecrow when i have brains i shall probably like them better  if i only had a heart i should love them added the tin woodman  i always did like flowers said the lion they seem so helpless and frail but there are none in the forest so bright as these  they now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies and fewer and fewer of the other flowers and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on forever but dorothy did not know this nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep  but the tin woodman would not let her do this  we must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark he said and the scarecrow agreed with him so they kept walking until dorothy could stand no longer her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies fast asleep  what shall we do asked the tin woodman  if we leave her here she will die said the lion the smell of the flowers is killing us all i myself can scarcely keep my eyes open and the dog is asleep already  it was true toto had fallen down beside his little mistress but the scarecrow and the tin woodman not being made of flesh were not troubled by the scent of the flowers  run fast said the scarecrow to the lion and get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can we will bring the little girl with us but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried  so the lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go in a moment he was out of sight  let us make a chair with our hands and carry her said the scarecrow so they picked up toto and put the dog in dorothy\\u2019s lap and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers  on and on they walked and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end they followed the bend of the river and at last came upon their friend the lion lying fast asleep among the poppies the flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them  we can do nothing for him said the tin woodman sadly for he is much too heavy to lift we must leave him here to sleep on forever and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last  i\\u2019m sorry said the scarecrow the lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly but let us go on  they carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her     chapter ix the queen of the field mice   we cannot be far from the road of yellow brick now remarked the scarecrow as he stood beside the girl for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away  the tin woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl and turning his head which worked beautifully on hinges he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them it was indeed a great yellow wildcat and the woodman thought it must be chasing something for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open showing two rows of ugly teeth while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire as it came nearer the tin woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the wildcat to try to kill such a pretty harmless creature  so the woodman raised his axe and as the wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast\\u2019s head clean off from its body and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces  the field mouse now that it was freed from its enemy stopped short and coming slowly up to the woodman it said in a squeaky little voice   oh thank you thank you ever so much for saving my life  don\\u2019t speak of it i beg of you replied the woodman i have no heart you know so i am careful to help all those who may need a friend even if it happens to be only a mouse  only a mouse cried the little animal indignantly why i am a queen\\u2014the queen of all the field mice  oh indeed said the woodman making a bow  therefore you have done a great deed as well as a brave one in saving my life added the queen  at that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them and when they saw their queen they exclaimed   oh your majesty we thought you would be killed how did you manage to escape the great wildcat they all bowed so low to the little queen that they almost stood upon their heads  this funny tin man she answered killed the wildcat and saved my life so hereafter you must all serve him and obey his slightest wish  we will cried all the mice in a shrill chorus and then they scampered in all directions for toto had awakened from his sleep and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in kansas and he saw no harm in it  but the tin woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight while he called to the mice come back come back toto shall not hurt you  at this the queen of the mice stuck her head out from underneath a clump of grass and asked in a timid voice are you sure he will not bite us  i will not let him said the woodman so do not be afraid  one by one the mice came creeping back and toto did not bark again although he tried to get out of the woodman\\u2019s arms and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin finally one of the biggest mice spoke  is there anything we can do it asked to repay you for saving the life of our queen  nothing that i know of answered the woodman but the scarecrow who had been trying to think but could not because his head was stuffed with straw said quickly oh yes you can save our friend the cowardly lion who is asleep in the poppy bed  a lion cried the little queen why he would eat us all up  oh no declared the scarecrow this lion is a coward  really asked the mouse  he says so himself answered the scarecrow and he would never hurt anyone who is our friend if you will help us to save him i promise that he shall treat you all with kindness  very well said the queen we trust you but what shall we do  are there many of these mice which call you queen and are willing to obey you  oh yes there are thousands she replied  then send for them all to come here as soon as possible and let each one bring a long piece of string  the queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people as soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible  now said the scarecrow to the tin woodman you must go to those trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the lion  so the woodman went at once to the trees and began to work and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches he fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk so fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them  they came from all directions and there were thousands of them  big mice and little mice and middle-sized mice and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth it was about this time that dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes she was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly but the scarecrow told her about everything and turning to the dignified little mouse he said   permit me to introduce to you her majesty the queen  dorothy nodded gravely and the queen made a curtsy after which she became quite friendly with the little girl  the scarecrow and the woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck using the strings they had brought one end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it but when all the mice had been harnessed they were able to pull it quite easily even the scarecrow and the tin woodman could sit on it and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the lion lay asleep  after a great deal of hard work for the lion was heavy they managed to get him up on the truck then the queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep  at first the little creatures many though they were could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck but the woodman and the scarecrow both pushed from behind and they got along better soon they rolled the lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields where he could breathe the sweet fresh air again instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers  dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death she had grown so fond of the big lion she was glad he had been rescued  then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes the queen of the mice was the last to leave  if ever you need us again she said come out into the field and call and we shall hear you and come to your assistance good-bye  good-bye they all answered and away the queen ran while dorothy held toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her  after this they sat down beside the lion until he should awaken and the scarecrow brought dorothy some fruit from a tree near by which she ate for her dinner     chapter x the guardian of the gate   it was some time before the cowardly lion awakened for he had lain among the poppies a long while breathing in their deadly fragrance but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive  i ran as fast as i could he said sitting down and yawning but the flowers were too strong for me how did you get me out  then they told him of the field mice and how they had generously saved him from death and the cowardly lion laughed and said   i have always thought myself very big and terrible yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me and such small animals as mice have saved my life how strange it all is but comrades what shall we do now  we must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again said dorothy and then we can keep on to the emerald city  so the lion being fully refreshed and feeling quite himself again they all started upon the journey greatly enjoying the walk through the soft fresh grass and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the emerald city where the great oz dwelt  the road was smooth and well paved now and the country about was beautiful so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades once more they could see fences built beside the road but these were painted green and when they came to a small house in which a farmer evidently lived that also was painted green they passed by several of these houses during the afternoon and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great lion of which they were very much afraid the people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the munchkins  this must be the land of oz said dorothy and we are surely getting near the emerald city  yes answered the scarecrow everything is green here while in the country of the munchkins blue was the favorite color but the people do not seem to be as friendly as the munchkins and i\\u2019m afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night  i should like something to eat besides fruit said the girl and i\\u2019m sure toto is nearly starved let us stop at the next house and talk to the people  so when they came to a good-sized farmhouse dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked  a woman opened it just far enough to look out and said what do you want child and why is that great lion with you  we wish to pass the night with you if you will allow us answered dorothy and the lion is my friend and comrade and would not hurt you for the world  is he tame asked the woman opening the door a little wider  oh yes said the girl and he is a great coward too he will be more afraid of you than you are of him  well said the woman after thinking it over and taking another peep at the lion if that is the case you may come in and i will give you some supper and a place to sleep  so they all entered the house where there were besides the woman two children and a man the man had hurt his leg and was lying on the couch in a corner they seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked   where are you all going  to the emerald city said dorothy to see the great oz  oh indeed exclaimed the man are you sure that oz will see you  why not she replied  why it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence i have been to the emerald city many times and it is a beautiful and wonderful place but i have never been permitted to see the great oz nor do i know of any living person who has seen him  does he never go out asked the scarecrow  never he sits day after day in the great throne room of his palace and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face  what is he like asked the girl  that is hard to tell said the man thoughtfully you see oz is a great wizard and can take on any form he wishes so that some say he looks like a bird and some say he looks like an elephant and some say he looks like a cat to others he appears as a beautiful fairy or a brownie or in any other form that pleases him but who the real oz is when he is in his own form no living person can tell  that is very strange said dorothy but we must try in some way to see him or we shall have made our journey for nothing  why do you wish to see the terrible oz asked the man  i want him to give me some brains said the scarecrow eagerly  oh oz could do that easily enough declared the man he has more brains than he needs  and i want him to give me a heart said the tin woodman  that will not trouble him continued the man for oz has a large collection of hearts of all sizes and shapes  and i want him to give me courage said the cowardly lion  oz keeps a great pot of courage in his throne room said the man which he has covered with a golden plate to keep it from running over he will be glad to give you some  and i want him to send me back to kansas said dorothy  where is kansas asked the man with surprise  i don\\u2019t know replied dorothy sorrowfully but it is my home and i\\u2019m sure it\\u2019s somewhere  very likely well oz can do anything so i suppose he will find kansas for you but first you must get to see him and that will be a hard task for the great wizard does not like to see anyone and he usually has his own way but what do you want he continued speaking to toto toto only wagged his tail for strange to say he could not speak  the woman now called to them that supper was ready so they gathered around the table and dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread and enjoyed her meal the lion ate some of the porridge but did not care for it saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses not for lions the scarecrow and the tin woodman ate nothing at all toto ate a little of everything and was glad to get a good supper again  the woman now gave dorothy a bed to sleep in and toto lay down beside her while the lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night although of course they could not sleep  the next morning as soon as the sun was up they started on their way and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them  that must be the emerald city said dorothy  as they walked on the green glow became brighter and brighter and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the city it was high and thick and of a bright green color  in front of them and at the end of the road of yellow brick was a big gate all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy  there was a bell beside the gate and dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within then the big gate swung slowly open and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds  before them stood a little man about the same size as the munchkins he was clothed all in green from his head to his feet and even his skin was of a greenish tint at his side was a large green box  when he saw dorothy and her companions the man asked what do you wish in the emerald city  we came here to see the great oz said dorothy  the man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over  it has been many years since anyone asked me to see oz he said shaking his head in perplexity he is powerful and terrible and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the great wizard he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant  but it is not a foolish errand nor an idle one replied the scarecrow it is important and we have been told that oz is a good wizard  so he is said the green man and he rules the emerald city wisely and well but to those who are not honest or who approach him from curiosity he is most terrible and few have ever dared ask to see his face i am the guardian of the gates and since you demand to see the great oz i must take you to his palace but first you must put on the spectacles  why asked dorothy  because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the emerald city would blind you even those who live in the city must wear spectacles night and day they are all locked on for oz so ordered it when the city was first built and i have the only key that will unlock them  he opened the big box and dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape all of them had green glasses in them the guardian of the gates found a pair that would just fit dorothy and put them over her eyes there were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the guardian of the gates wore around his neck when they were on dorothy could not take them off had she wished but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the emerald city so she said nothing  then the green man fitted spectacles for the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion and even on little toto and all were locked fast with the key  then the guardian of the gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the palace taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall he opened another gate and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the emerald city     chapter xi the wonderful city of oz   even with eyes protected by the green spectacles dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful city the streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds they walked over a pavement of the same green marble and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds set closely and glittering in the brightness of the sun the window panes were of green glass even the sky above the city had a green tint and the rays of the sun were green  there were many people\\u2014men women and children\\u2014walking about and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins they looked at dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the lion but no one spoke to them many shops stood in the street and dorothy saw that everything in them was green green candy and green pop-corn were offered for sale as well as green shoes green hats and green clothes of all sorts at one place a man was selling green lemonade and when the children bought it dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies  there seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind the men carried things around in little green carts which they pushed before them everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous  the guardian of the gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building exactly in the middle of the city which was the palace of oz the great wizard there was a soldier before the door dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard  here are strangers said the guardian of the gates to him and they demand to see the great oz  step inside answered the soldier and i will carry your message to him  so they passed through the palace gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds the soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room and when they were seated he said politely   please make yourselves comfortable while i go to the door of the throne room and tell oz you are here  they had to wait a long time before the soldier returned when at last he came back dorothy asked   have you seen oz  oh no returned the soldier i have never seen him but i spoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message he said he will grant you an audience if you so desire but each one of you must enter his presence alone and he will admit but one each day therefore as you must remain in the palace for several days i will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey  thank you replied the girl that is very kind of oz  the soldier now blew upon a green whistle and at once a young girl dressed in a pretty green silk gown entered the room she had lovely green hair and green eyes and she bowed low before dorothy as she said follow me and i will show you your room  so dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except toto and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the palace it was the sweetest little room in the world with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane there was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room that shot a spray of green perfume into the air to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin beautiful green flowers stood in the windows and there was a shelf with a row of little green books when dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh they were so funny  in a wardrobe were many green dresses made of silk and satin and velvet and all of them fitted dorothy exactly  make yourself perfectly at home said the green girl and if you wish for anything ring the bell oz will send for you tomorrow morning  she left dorothy alone and went back to the others these she also led to rooms and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the palace of course this politeness was wasted on the scarecrow for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot just within the doorway to wait till morning it would not rest him to lie down and he could not close his eyes so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world the tin woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit for he remembered when he was made of flesh but not being able to sleep he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order the lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest and did not like being shut up in a room but he had too much sense to let this worry him so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute  the next morning after breakfast the green maiden came to fetch dorothy and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns made of green brocaded satin dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around toto\\u2019s neck and they started for the throne room of the great oz  first they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court all dressed in rich costumes these people had nothing to do but talk to each other but they always came to wait outside the throne room every morning although they were never permitted to see oz as dorothy entered they looked at her curiously and one of them whispered   are you really going to look upon the face of oz the terrible  of course answered the girl if he will see me  oh he will see you said the soldier who had taken her message to the wizard although he does not like to have people ask to see him indeed at first he was angry and said i should send you back where you came from then he asked me what you looked like and when i mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested at last i told him about the mark upon your forehead and he decided he would admit you to his presence  just then a bell rang and the green girl said to dorothy that is the signal you must go into the throne room alone  she opened a little door and dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place it was a big round room with a high arched roof and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together in the center of the roof was a great light as bright as the sun which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner  but what interested dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room it was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems as did everything else in the center of the chair was an enormous head without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever there was no hair upon this head but it had eyes and a nose and mouth and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant  as dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily then the mouth moved and dorothy heard a voice say   i am oz the great and terrible who are you and why do you seek me  it was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big head so she took courage and answered   i am dorothy the small and meek i have come to you for help  the eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute then said the voice   where did you get the silver shoes  i got them from the wicked witch of the east when my house fell on her and killed her she replied  where did you get the mark upon your forehead continued the voice  that is where the good witch of the north kissed me when she bade me good-bye and sent me to you said the girl  again the eyes looked at her sharply and they saw she was telling the truth then oz asked what do you wish me to do  send me back to kansas where my aunt em and uncle henry are she answered earnestly i don\\u2019t like your country although it is so beautiful and i am sure aunt em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long  the eyes winked three times and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room and at last they looked at dorothy again  why should i do this for you asked oz  because you are strong and i am weak because you are a great wizard and i am only a little girl  but you were strong enough to kill the wicked witch of the east said oz  that just happened returned dorothy simply i could not help it  well said the head i will give you my answer you have no right to expect me to send you back to kansas unless you do something for me in return in this country everyone must pay for everything he gets if you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first help me and i will help you  what must i do asked the girl  kill the wicked witch of the west answered oz  but i cannot exclaimed dorothy greatly surprised  you killed the witch of the east and you wear the silver shoes which bear a powerful charm there is now but one wicked witch left in all this land and when you can tell me she is dead i will send you back to kansas\\u2014but not before  the little girl began to weep she was so much disappointed and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously as if the great oz felt that she could help him if she would  i never killed anything willingly she sobbed even if i wanted to how could i kill the wicked witch if you who are great and terrible cannot kill her yourself how do you expect me to do it  i do not know said the head but that is my answer and until the wicked witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again remember that the witch is wicked\\u2014tremendously wicked\\u2014and ought to be killed now go and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task  sorrowfully dorothy left the throne room and went back where the lion and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were waiting to hear what oz had said to her there is no hope for me she said sadly for oz will not send me home until i have killed the wicked witch of the west and that i can never do  her friends were sorry but could do nothing to help her so dorothy went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep  the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the scarecrow and said   come with me for oz has sent for you  so the scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great throne room where he saw sitting in the emerald throne a most lovely lady she was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels growing from her shoulders were wings gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them  when the scarecrow had bowed as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him before this beautiful creature she looked upon him sweetly and said   i am oz the great and terrible who are you and why do you seek me  now the scarecrow who had expected to see the great head dorothy had told him of was much astonished but he answered her bravely  i am only a scarecrow stuffed with straw therefore i have no brains and i come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw so that i may become as much a man as any other in your dominions  why should i do this for you asked the lady  because you are wise and powerful and no one else can help me answered the scarecrow  i never grant favors without some return said oz but this much i will promise if you will kill for me the wicked witch of the west i will bestow upon you a great many brains and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the land of oz  i thought you asked dorothy to kill the witch said the scarecrow in surprise  so i did i don\\u2019t care who kills her but until she is dead i will not grant your wish now go and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire  the scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what oz had said and dorothy was surprised to find that the great wizard was not a head as she had seen him but a lovely lady  all the same said the scarecrow she needs a heart as much as the tin woodman  on the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the tin woodman and said   oz has sent for you follow me  so the tin woodman followed him and came to the great throne room he did not know whether he would find oz a lovely lady or a head but he hoped it would be the lovely lady for he said to himself if it is the head i am sure i shall not be given a heart since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me but if it is the lovely lady i shall beg hard for a heart for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted  but when the woodman entered the great throne room he saw neither the head nor the lady for oz had taken the shape of a most terrible beast it was nearly as big as an elephant and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight the beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros only there were five eyes in its face there were five long arms growing out of its body and it also had five long slim legs thick woolly hair covered every part of it and a more dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined it was fortunate the tin woodman had no heart at that moment for it would have beat loud and fast from terror but being only tin the woodman was not at all afraid although he was much disappointed  i am oz the great and terrible spoke the beast in a voice that was one great roar who are you and why do you seek me  i am a woodman and made of tin therefore i have no heart and cannot love i pray you to give me a heart that i may be as other men are  why should i do this demanded the beast  because i ask it and you alone can grant my request answered the woodman  oz gave a low growl at this but said gruffly  if you indeed desire a heart you must earn it  how asked the woodman  help dorothy to kill the wicked witch of the west replied the beast when the witch is dead come to me and i will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the land of oz  so the tin woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible beast he had seen they all wondered greatly at the many forms the great wizard could take upon himself and the lion said   if he is a beast when i go to see him i shall roar my loudest and so frighten him that he will grant all i ask and if he is the lovely lady i shall pretend to spring upon her and so compel her to do my bidding and if he is the great head he will be at my mercy for i will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us what we desire so be of good cheer my friends for all will yet be well  the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the lion to the great throne room and bade him enter the presence of oz  the lion at once passed through the door and glancing around saw to his surprise that before the throne was a ball of fire so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it his first thought was that oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up but when he tried to go nearer the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door  then a low quiet voice came from the ball of fire and these were the words it spoke   i am oz the great and terrible who are you and why do you seek me  and the lion answered i am a cowardly lion afraid of everything i came to you to beg that you give me courage so that in reality i may become the king of beasts as men call me  why should i give you courage demanded oz  because of all wizards you are the greatest and alone have power to grant my request answered the lion  the ball of fire burned fiercely for a time and the voice said bring me proof that the wicked witch is dead and that moment i will give you courage but as long as the witch lives you must remain a coward  the lion was angry at this speech but could say nothing in reply and while he stood silently gazing at the ball of fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room he was glad to find his friends waiting for him and told them of his terrible interview with the wizard  what shall we do now asked dorothy sadly  there is only one thing we can do returned the lion and that is to go to the land of the winkies seek out the wicked witch and destroy her  but suppose we cannot said the girl  then i shall never have courage declared the lion  and i shall never have brains added the scarecrow  and i shall never have a heart spoke the tin woodman  and i shall never see aunt em and uncle henry said dorothy beginning to cry  be careful cried the green girl the tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it  so dorothy dried her eyes and said i suppose we must try it but i am sure i do not want to kill anybody even to see aunt em again  i will go with you but i\\u2019m too much of a coward to kill the witch said the lion  i will go too declared the scarecrow but i shall not be of much help to you i am such a fool  i haven\\u2019t the heart to harm even a witch remarked the tin woodman but if you go i certainly shall go with you  therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning and the woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled the scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better the green girl who was very kind to them filled dorothy\\u2019s basket with good things to eat and fastened a little bell around toto\\u2019s neck with a green ribbon  they went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the palace and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg     chapter xii the search for the wicked witch   the soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the emerald city until they reached the room where the guardian of the gates lived this officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box and then he politely opened the gate for our friends  which road leads to the wicked witch of the west asked dorothy  there is no road answered the guardian of the gates no one ever wishes to go that way  how then are we to find her inquired the girl  that will be easy replied the man for when she knows you are in the country of the winkies she will find you and make you all her slaves  perhaps not said the scarecrow for we mean to destroy her  oh that is different said the guardian of the gates no one has ever destroyed her before so i naturally thought she would make slaves of you as she has of the rest but take care for she is wicked and fierce and may not allow you to destroy her keep to the west where the sun sets and you cannot fail to find her  they thanked him and bade him good-bye and turned toward the west walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace but now to her surprise she found it was no longer green but pure white the ribbon around toto\\u2019s neck had also lost its green color and was as white as dorothy\\u2019s dress  the emerald city was soon left far behind as they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the west and the ground was untilled  in the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces for there were no trees to offer them shade so that before night dorothy and toto and the lion were tired and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep with the woodman and the scarecrow keeping watch  now the wicked witch of the west had but one eye yet that was as powerful as a telescope and could see everywhere so as she sat in the door of her castle she happened to look around and saw dorothy lying asleep with her friends all about her they were a long distance off but the wicked witch was angry to find them in her country so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck  at once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves they had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth  go to those people said the witch and tear them to pieces  are you not going to make them your slaves asked the leader of the wolves  no she answered one is of tin and one of straw one is a girl and another a lion none of them is fit to work so you may tear them into small pieces  very well said the wolf and he dashed away at full speed followed by the others  it was lucky the scarecrow and the woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming  this is my fight said the woodman so get behind me and i will meet them as they come  he seized his axe which he had made very sharp and as the leader of the wolves came on the tin woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf\\u2019s head from its body so that it immediately died as soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up and he also fell under the sharp edge of the tin woodman\\u2019s weapon there were forty wolves and forty times a wolf was killed so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the woodman  then he put down his axe and sat beside the scarecrow who said it was a good fight friend  they waited until dorothy awoke the next morning the little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves but the tin woodman told her all she thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast after which they started again upon their journey  now this same morning the wicked witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off she saw all her wolves lying dead and the strangers still traveling through her country this made her angrier than before and she blew her silver whistle twice  straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her enough to darken the sky  and the wicked witch said to the king crow fly at once to the strangers peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces  the wild crows flew in one great flock toward dorothy and her companions when the little girl saw them coming she was afraid  but the scarecrow said this is my battle so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed  so they all lay upon the ground except the scarecrow and he stood up and stretched out his arms and when the crows saw him they were frightened as these birds always are by scarecrows and did not dare to come any nearer but the king crow said   it is only a stuffed man i will peck his eyes out  the king crow flew at the scarecrow who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died and then another crow flew at him and the scarecrow twisted its neck also there were forty crows and forty times the scarecrow twisted a neck until at last all were lying dead beside him then he called to his companions to rise and again they went upon their journey  when the wicked witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap she got into a terrible rage and blew three times upon her silver whistle  forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air and a swarm of black bees came flying toward her  go to the strangers and sting them to death commanded the witch and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where dorothy and her friends were walking but the woodman had seen them coming and the scarecrow had decided what to do  take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the lion he said to the woodman and the bees cannot sting them this the woodman did and as dorothy lay close beside the lion and held toto in her arms the straw covered them entirely  the bees came and found no one but the woodman to sting so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin without hurting the woodman at all and as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees and they lay scattered thick about the woodman like little heaps of fine coal  then dorothy and the lion got up and the girl helped the tin woodman put the straw back into the scarecrow again until he was as good as ever so they started upon their journey once more  the wicked witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth and then she called a dozen of her slaves who were the winkies and gave them sharp spears telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them  the winkies were not a brave people but they had to do as they were told so they marched away until they came near to dorothy then the lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them and the poor winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could  when they returned to the castle the wicked witch beat them well with a strap and sent them back to their work after which she sat down to think what she should do next she could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed but she was a powerful witch as well as a wicked one and she soon made up her mind how to act  there was in her cupboard a golden cap with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it this golden cap had a charm whoever owned it could call three times upon the winged monkeys who would obey any order they were given but no person could command these strange creatures more than three times twice already the wicked witch had used the charm of the cap once was when she had made the winkies her slaves and set herself to rule over their country the winged monkeys had helped her do this the second time was when she had fought against the great oz himself and driven him out of the land of the west the winged monkeys had also helped her in doing this only once more could she use this golden cap for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted but now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone and her slaves had been scared away by the cowardly lion she saw there was only one way left to destroy dorothy and her friends  so the wicked witch took the golden cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly   ep-pe pep-pe kak-ke  next she stood upon her right foot and said   hil-lo hol-lo hel-lo  after this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice   ziz-zy zuz-zy zik  now the charm began to work the sky was darkened and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air there was a rushing of many wings a great chattering and laughing and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the wicked witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders  one much bigger than the others seemed to be their leader he flew close to the witch and said you have called us for the third and last time what do you command  go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the lion said the wicked witch bring that beast to me for i have a mind to harness him like a horse and make him work  your commands shall be obeyed said the leader then with a great deal of chattering and noise the winged monkeys flew away to the place where dorothy and her friends were walking  some of the monkeys seized the tin woodman and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks here they dropped the poor woodman who fell a great distance to the rocks where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan  others of the monkeys caught the scarecrow and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head they made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree  the remaining monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the lion and wound many coils about his body and head and legs until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the witch\\u2019s castle where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it so that he could not escape  but dorothy they did not harm at all she stood with toto in her arms watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn the leader of the winged monkeys flew up to her his long hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly but he saw the mark of the good witch\\u2019s kiss upon her forehead and stopped short motioning the others not to touch her  we dare not harm this little girl he said to them for she is protected by the power of good and that is greater than the power of evil all we can do is to carry her to the castle of the wicked witch and leave her there  so carefully and gently they lifted dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle where they set her down upon the front doorstep then the leader said to the witch   we have obeyed you as far as we were able the tin woodman and the scarecrow are destroyed and the lion is tied up in your yard the little girl we dare not harm nor the dog she carries in her arms your power over our band is now ended and you will never see us again  then all the winged monkeys with much laughing and chattering and noise flew into the air and were soon out of sight  the wicked witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on dorothy\\u2019s forehead for she knew well that neither the winged monkeys nor she herself dare hurt the girl in any way she looked down at dorothy\\u2019s feet and seeing the silver shoes began to tremble with fear for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them at first the witch was tempted to run away from dorothy but she happened to look into the child\\u2019s eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the silver shoes gave her so the wicked witch laughed to herself and thought i can still make her my slave for she does not know how to use her power then she said to dorothy harshly and severely   come with me and see that you mind everything i tell you for if you do not i will make an end of you as i did of the tin woodman and the scarecrow  dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen where the witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood  dorothy went to work meekly with her mind made up to work as hard as she could for she was glad the wicked witch had decided not to kill her  with dorothy hard at work the witch thought she would go into the courtyard and harness the cowardly lion like a horse it would amuse her she was sure to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive but as she opened the gate the lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the witch was afraid and ran out and shut the gate again  if i cannot harness you said the witch to the lion speaking through the bars of the gate i can starve you you shall have nothing to eat until you do as i wish  so after that she took no food to the imprisoned lion but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked are you ready to be harnessed like a horse  and the lion would answer no if you come in this yard i will bite you  the reason the lion did not have to do as the witch wished was that every night while the woman was asleep dorothy carried him food from the cupboard after he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw and dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft shaggy mane while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape but they could find no way to get out of the castle for it was constantly guarded by the yellow winkies who were the slaves of the wicked witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them  the girl had to work hard during the day and often the witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand but in truth she did not dare to strike dorothy because of the mark upon her forehead the child did not know this and was full of fear for herself and toto once the witch struck toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in return the witch did not bleed where she was bitten for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before  dorothy\\u2019s life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to kansas and aunt em again sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours with toto sitting at her feet and looking into her face whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress toto did not really care whether he was in kansas or the land of oz so long as dorothy was with him but he knew the little girl was unhappy and that made him unhappy too  now the wicked witch had a great longing to have for her own the silver shoes which the girl always wore her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying in heaps and drying up and she had used up all the power of the golden cap but if she could only get hold of the silver shoes they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost she watched dorothy carefully to see if she ever took off her shoes thinking she might steal them but the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath the witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in dorothy\\u2019s room at night to take the shoes and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark so she never came near when dorothy was bathing indeed the old witch never touched water nor ever let water touch her in any way  but the wicked creature was very cunning and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted she placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes so that when dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar not being able to see it and fell at full length she was not much hurt but in her fall one of the silver shoes came off and before she could reach it the witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot  the wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm and dorothy could not use it against her even had she known how to do so  the little girl seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes grew angry and said to the witch give me back my shoe  i will not retorted the witch for it is now my shoe and not yours  you are a wicked creature cried dorothy you have no right to take my shoe from me  i shall keep it just the same said the witch laughing at her and someday i shall get the other one from you too  this made dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the witch wetting her from head to foot  instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear and then as dorothy looked at her in wonder the witch began to shrink and fall away  see what you have done she screamed in a minute i shall melt away  i\\u2019m very sorry indeed said dorothy who was truly frightened to see the witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes  didn\\u2019t you know water would be the end of me asked the witch in a wailing despairing voice  of course not answered dorothy how should i  well in a few minutes i shall be all melted and you will have the castle to yourself i have been wicked in my day but i never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds look out\\u2014here i go  with these words the witch fell down in a brown melted shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor seeing that she had really melted away to nothing dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess she then swept it all out the door after picking out the silver shoe which was all that was left of the old woman she cleaned and dried it with a cloth and put it on her foot again then being at last free to do as she chose she ran out to the courtyard to tell the lion that the wicked witch of the west had come to an end and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land     chapter xiii the rescue   the cowardly lion was much pleased to hear that the wicked witch had been melted by a bucket of water and dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free they went in together to the castle where dorothy\\u2019s first act was to call all the winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves  there was great rejoicing among the yellow winkies for they had been made to work hard during many years for the wicked witch who had always treated them with great cruelty they kept this day as a holiday then and ever after and spent the time in feasting and dancing  if our friends the scarecrow and the tin woodman were only with us said the lion i should be quite happy  don\\u2019t you suppose we could rescue them asked the girl anxiously  we can try answered the lion  so they called the yellow winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends and the winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for dorothy who had set them free from bondage so she chose a number of the winkies who looked as if they knew the most and they all started away they traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the tin woodman lay all battered and bent his axe was near him but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short  the winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms and carried him back to the yellow castle again dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend and the lion looking sober and sorry when they reached the castle dorothy said to the winkies   are any of your people tinsmiths  oh yes some of us are very good tinsmiths they told her  then bring them to me she said and when the tinsmiths came bringing with them all their tools in baskets she inquired can you straighten out those dents in the tin woodman and bend him back into shape again and solder him together where he is broken  the tinsmiths looked the woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever so they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the tin woodman until at last he was straightened out into his old form and his joints worked as well as ever to be sure there were several patches on him but the tinsmiths did a good job and as the woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all  when at last he walked into dorothy\\u2019s room and thanked her for rescuing him he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy and dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron so his joints would not be rusted at the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again and these tears did not need to be wiped away as for the lion he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried  if we only had the scarecrow with us again said the tin woodman when dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened i should be quite happy  we must try to find him said the girl  so she called the winkies to help her and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the winged monkeys had tossed the scarecrow\\u2019s clothes  it was a very tall tree and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it but the woodman said at once i\\u2019ll chop it down and then we can get the scarecrow\\u2019s clothes  now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the woodman himself another of the winkies who was a goldsmith had made an axe-handle of solid gold and fitted it to the woodman\\u2019s axe instead of the old broken handle others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver  as soon as he had spoken the tin woodman began to chop and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash whereupon the scarecrow\\u2019s clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground  dorothy picked them up and had the winkies carry them back to the castle where they were stuffed with nice clean straw and behold here was the scarecrow as good as ever thanking them over and over again for saving him  now that they were reunited dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the yellow castle where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable  but one day the girl thought of aunt em and said we must go back to oz and claim his promise  yes said the woodman at last i shall get my heart  and i shall get my brains added the scarecrow joyfully  and i shall get my courage said the lion thoughtfully  and i shall get back to kansas cried dorothy clapping her hands oh let us start for the emerald city tomorrow  this they decided to do the next day they called the winkies together and bade them good-bye the winkies were sorry to have them go and they had grown so fond of the tin woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the yellow land of the west finding they were determined to go the winkies gave toto and the lion each a golden collar and to dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds and to the scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick to keep him from stumbling and to the tin woodman they offered a silver oil-can inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels  every one of the travelers made the winkies a pretty speech in return and all shook hands with them until their arms ached  dorothy went to the witch\\u2019s cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey and there she saw the golden cap she tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly she did not know anything about the charm of the golden cap but she saw that it was pretty so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket  then being prepared for the journey they all started for the emerald city and the winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them     chapter xiv the winged monkeys   you will remember there was no road\\u2014not even a pathway\\u2014between the castle of the wicked witch and the emerald city when the four travelers went in search of the witch she had seen them coming and so sent the winged monkeys to bring them to her it was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried they knew of course they must go straight east toward the rising sun and they started off in the right way but at noon when the sun was over their heads they did not know which was east and which was west and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields they kept on walking however and at night the moon came out and shone brightly so they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning\\u2014all but the scarecrow and the tin woodman  the next morning the sun was behind a cloud but they started on as if they were quite sure which way they were going  if we walk far enough said dorothy i am sure we shall sometime come to some place  but day by day passed away and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields the scarecrow began to grumble a bit  we have surely lost our way he said and unless we find it again in time to reach the emerald city i shall never get my brains  nor i my heart declared the tin woodman it seems to me i can scarcely wait till i get to oz and you must admit this is a very long journey  you see said the cowardly lion with a whimper i haven\\u2019t the courage to keep tramping forever without getting anywhere at all  then dorothy lost heart she sat down on the grass and looked at her companions and they sat down and looked at her and toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head so he put out his tongue and panted and looked at dorothy as if to ask what they should do next  suppose we call the field mice she suggested they could probably tell us the way to the emerald city  to be sure they could cried the scarecrow why didn\\u2019t we think of that before  dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the queen of the mice had given it to her in a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet and many of the small gray mice came running up to her among them was the queen herself who asked in her squeaky little voice   what can i do for my friends  we have lost our way said dorothy can you tell us where the emerald city is  certainly answered the queen but it is a great way off for you have had it at your backs all this time then she noticed dorothy\\u2019s golden cap and said why don\\u2019t you use the charm of the cap and call the winged monkeys to you they will carry you to the city of oz in less than an hour  i didn\\u2019t know there was a charm answered dorothy in surprise what is it  it is written inside the golden cap replied the queen of the mice but if you are going to call the winged monkeys we must run away for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us  won\\u2019t they hurt me asked the girl anxiously  oh no they must obey the wearer of the cap good-bye and she scampered out of sight with all the mice hurrying after her  dorothy looked inside the golden cap and saw some words written upon the lining these she thought must be the charm so she read the directions carefully and put the cap upon her head  ep-pe pep-pe kak-ke she said standing on her left foot  what did you say asked the scarecrow who did not know what she was doing  hil-lo hol-lo hel-lo dorothy went on standing this time on her right foot  hello replied the tin woodman calmly  ziz-zy zuz-zy zik said dorothy who was now standing on both feet this ended the saying of the charm and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings as the band of winged monkeys flew up to them  the king bowed low before dorothy and asked what is your command  we wish to go to the emerald city said the child and we have lost our way  we will carry you replied the king and no sooner had he spoken than two of the monkeys caught dorothy in their arms and flew away with her others took the scarecrow and the woodman and the lion and one little monkey seized toto and flew after them although the dog tried hard to bite him  the scarecrow and the tin woodman were rather frightened at first for they remembered how badly the winged monkeys had treated them before but they saw that no harm was intended so they rode through the air quite cheerfully and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them  dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest monkeys one of them the king himself they had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her  why do you have to obey the charm of the golden cap she asked  that is a long story answered the king with a winged laugh but as we have a long journey before us i will pass the time by telling you about it if you wish  i shall be glad to hear it she replied  once began the leader we were a free people living happily in the great forest flying from tree to tree eating nuts and fruit and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings chasing birds and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest but we were careless and happy and full of fun and enjoyed every minute of the day this was many years ago long before oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land  there lived here then away at the north a beautiful princess who was also a powerful sorceress all her magic was used to help the people and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good her name was gayelette and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby everyone loved her but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise at last however she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish when he grew to manhood quelala as he was called was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land while his manly beauty was so great that gayelette loved him dearly and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding  my grandfather was at that time the king of the winged monkeys which lived in the forest near gayelette\\u2019s palace and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner one day just before the wedding my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw quelala walking beside the river he was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do at his word the band flew down and seized quelala carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river and then dropped him into the water  \\u2018swim out my fine fellow\\u2019 cried my grandfather \\u2018and see if the water has spotted your clothes\\u2019 quelala was much too wise not to swim and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune he laughed when he came to the top of the water and swam in to shore but when gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river  the princess was angry and she knew of course who did it she had all the winged monkeys brought before her and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated quelala and dropped in the river but my grandfather pleaded hard for he knew the monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied and quelala said a kind word for them also so that gayelette finally spared them on condition that the winged monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the golden cap this cap had been made for a wedding present to quelala and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom of course my grandfather and all the other monkeys at once agreed to the condition and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the golden cap whosoever he may be  and what became of them asked dorothy who had been greatly interested in the story  quelala being the first owner of the golden cap replied the monkey he was the first to lay his wishes upon us as his bride could not bear the sight of us he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a winged monkey which we were glad to do for we were all afraid of her  this was all we ever had to do until the golden cap fell into the hands of the wicked witch of the west who made us enslave the winkies and afterward drive oz himself out of the land of the west now the golden cap is yours and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us  as the monkey king finished his story dorothy looked down and saw the green shining walls of the emerald city before them she wondered at the rapid flight of the monkeys but was glad the journey was over the strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the city the king bowed low to dorothy and then flew swiftly away followed by all his band  that was a good ride said the little girl  yes and a quick way out of our troubles replied the lion how lucky it was you brought away that wonderful cap     chapter xv the discovery of oz the terrible   the four travelers walked up to the great gate of emerald city and rang the bell after ringing several times it was opened by the same guardian of the gates they had met before  what are you back again he asked in surprise  do you not see us answered the scarecrow  but i thought you had gone to visit the wicked witch of the west  we did visit her said the scarecrow  and she let you go again asked the man in wonder  she could not help it for she is melted explained the scarecrow  melted well that is good news indeed said the man who melted her  it was dorothy said the lion gravely  good gracious exclaimed the man and he bowed very low indeed before her  then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes just as he had done before afterward they passed on through the gate into the emerald city when the people heard from the guardian of the gates that dorothy had melted the wicked witch of the west they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the palace of oz  the soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door but he let them in at once and they were again met by the beautiful green girl who showed each of them to their old rooms at once so they might rest until the great oz was ready to receive them  the soldier had the news carried straight to oz that dorothy and the other travelers had come back again after destroying the wicked witch but oz made no reply they thought the great wizard would send for them at once but he did not they had no word from him the next day nor the next nor the next the waiting was tiresome and wearing and at last they grew vexed that oz should treat them in so poor a fashion after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery so the scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to oz saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the winged monkeys to help them and find out whether he kept his promises or not when the wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the throne room at four minutes after nine o\\u2019clock the next morning he had once met the winged monkeys in the land of the west and he did not wish to meet them again  the four travelers passed a sleepless night each thinking of the gift oz had promised to bestow on him dorothy fell asleep only once and then she dreamed she was in kansas where aunt em was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again  promptly at nine o\\u2019clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier came to them and four minutes later they all went into the throne room of the great oz  of course each one of them expected to see the wizard in the shape he had taken before and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room they kept close to the door and closer to one another for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen oz take  presently they heard a solemn voice that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome and it said   i am oz the great and terrible why do you seek me  they looked again in every part of the room and then seeing no one dorothy asked where are you  i am everywhere answered the voice but to the eyes of common mortals i am invisible i will now seat myself upon my throne that you may converse with me indeed the voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself so they walked toward it and stood in a row while dorothy said   we have come to claim our promise o oz  what promise asked oz  you promised to send me back to kansas when the wicked witch was destroyed said the girl  and you promised to give me brains said the scarecrow  and you promised to give me a heart said the tin woodman  and you promised to give me courage said the cowardly lion  is the wicked witch really destroyed asked the voice and dorothy thought it trembled a little  yes she answered i melted her with a bucket of water  dear me said the voice how sudden well come to me tomorrow for i must have time to think it over  you\\u2019ve had plenty of time already said the tin woodman angrily  we shan\\u2019t wait a day longer said the scarecrow  you must keep your promises to us exclaimed dorothy  the lion thought it might be as well to frighten the wizard so he gave a large loud roar which was so fierce and dreadful that toto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner as it fell with a crash they looked that way and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder for they saw standing in just the spot the screen had hidden a little old man with a bald head and a wrinkled face who seemed to be as much surprised as they were the tin woodman raising his axe rushed toward the little man and cried out who are you  i am oz the great and terrible said the little man in a trembling voice but don\\u2019t strike me\\u2014please don\\u2019t\\u2014and i\\u2019ll do anything you want me to  our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay  i thought oz was a great head said dorothy  and i thought oz was a lovely lady said the scarecrow  and i thought oz was a terrible beast said the tin woodman  and i thought oz was a ball of fire exclaimed the lion  no you are all wrong said the little man meekly i have been making believe  making believe cried dorothy are you not a great wizard  hush my dear he said don\\u2019t speak so loud or you will be overheard\\u2014and i should be ruined i\\u2019m supposed to be a great wizard  and aren\\u2019t you she asked  not a bit of it my dear i\\u2019m just a common man  you\\u2019re more than that said the scarecrow in a grieved tone you\\u2019re a humbug  exactly so declared the little man rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him i am a humbug  but this is terrible said the tin woodman how shall i ever get my heart  or i my courage asked the lion  or i my brains wailed the scarecrow wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve  my dear friends said oz i pray you not to speak of these little things think of me and the terrible trouble i\\u2019m in at being found out  doesn\\u2019t anyone else know you\\u2019re a humbug asked dorothy  no one knows it but you four\\u2014and myself replied oz i have fooled everyone so long that i thought i should never be found out it was a great mistake my ever letting you into the throne room usually i will not see even my subjects and so they believe i am something terrible  but i don\\u2019t understand said dorothy in bewilderment how was it that you appeared to me as a great head  that was one of my tricks answered oz step this way please and i will tell you all about it  he led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the throne room and they all followed him he pointed to one corner in which lay the great head made out of many thicknesses of paper and with a carefully painted face  this i hung from the ceiling by a wire said oz i stood behind the screen and pulled a thread to make the eyes move and the mouth open  but how about the voice she inquired  oh i am a ventriloquist said the little man i can throw the sound of my voice wherever i wish so that you thought it was coming out of the head here are the other things i used to deceive you he showed the scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely lady and the tin woodman saw that his terrible beast was nothing but a lot of skins sewn together with slats to keep their sides out as for the ball of fire the false wizard had hung that also from the ceiling it was really a ball of cotton but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely  really said the scarecrow you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug  i am\\u2014i certainly am answered the little man sorrowfully but it was the only thing i could do sit down please there are plenty of chairs and i will tell you my story  so they sat down and listened while he told the following tale  i was born in omaha\\u2014  why that isn\\u2019t very far from kansas cried dorothy  no but it\\u2019s farther from here he said shaking his head at her sadly when i grew up i became a ventriloquist and at that i was very well trained by a great master i can imitate any kind of a bird or beast here he mewed so like a kitten that toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was after a time continued oz i tired of that and became a balloonist  what is that asked dorothy  a man who goes up in a balloon on circus day so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus he explained  oh she said i know  well one day i went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted so that i couldn\\u2019t come down again it went way up above the clouds so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many many miles away for a day and a night i traveled through the air and on the morning of the second day i awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country  it came down gradually and i was not hurt a bit but i found myself in the midst of a strange people who seeing me come from the clouds thought i was a great wizard of course i let them think so because they were afraid of me and promised to do anything i wished them to  just to amuse myself and keep the good people busy i ordered them to build this city and my palace and they did it all willingly and well then i thought as the country was so green and beautiful i would call it the emerald city and to make the name fit better i put green spectacles on all the people so that everything they saw was green  but isn\\u2019t everything here green asked dorothy  no more than in any other city replied oz but when you wear green spectacles why of course everything you see looks green to you the emerald city was built a great many years ago for i was a young man when the balloon brought me here and i am a very old man now but my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an emerald city and it certainly is a beautiful place abounding in jewels and precious metals and every good thing that is needed to make one happy i have been good to the people and they like me but ever since this palace was built i have shut myself up and would not see any of them  one of my greatest fears was the witches for while i had no magical powers at all i soon found out that the witches were really able to do wonderful things there were four of them in this country and they ruled the people who live in the north and south and east and west fortunately the witches of the north and south were good and i knew they would do me no harm but the witches of the east and west were terribly wicked and had they not thought i was more powerful than they themselves they would surely have destroyed me as it was i lived in deadly fear of them for many years so you can imagine how pleased i was when i heard your house had fallen on the wicked witch of the east when you came to me i was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other witch but now that you have melted her i am ashamed to say that i cannot keep my promises  i think you are a very bad man said dorothy  oh no my dear i\\u2019m really a very good man but i\\u2019m a very bad wizard i must admit  can\\u2019t you give me brains asked the scarecrow  you don\\u2019t need them you are learning something every day a baby has brains but it doesn\\u2019t know much experience is the only thing that brings knowledge and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get  that may all be true said the scarecrow but i shall be very unhappy unless you give me brains  the false wizard looked at him carefully  well he said with a sigh i\\u2019m not much of a magician as i said but if you will come to me tomorrow morning i will stuff your head with brains i cannot tell you how to use them however you must find that out for yourself  oh thank you\\u2014thank you cried the scarecrow i\\u2019ll find a way to use them never fear  but how about my courage asked the lion anxiously  you have plenty of courage i am sure answered oz all you need is confidence in yourself there is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger the true courage is in facing danger when you are afraid and that kind of courage you have in plenty  perhaps i have but i\\u2019m scared just the same said the lion i shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid  very well i will give you that sort of courage tomorrow replied oz  how about my heart asked the tin woodman  why as for that answered oz i think you are wrong to want a heart it makes most people unhappy if you only knew it you are in luck not to have a heart  that must be a matter of opinion said the tin woodman for my part i will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur if you will give me the heart  very well answered oz meekly come to me tomorrow and you shall have a heart i have played wizard for so many years that i may as well continue the part a little longer  and now said dorothy how am i to get back to kansas  we shall have to think about that replied the little man give me two or three days to consider the matter and i\\u2019ll try to find a way to carry you over the desert in the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests and while you live in the palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish there is only one thing i ask in return for my help\\u2014such as it is you must keep my secret and tell no one i am a humbug  they agreed to say nothing of what they had learned and went back to their rooms in high spirits even dorothy had hope that the great and terrible humbug as she called him would find a way to send her back to kansas and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything     chapter xvi the magic art of the great humbug   next morning the scarecrow said to his friends   congratulate me i am going to oz to get my brains at last when i return i shall be as other men are  i have always liked you as you were said dorothy simply  it is kind of you to like a scarecrow he replied but surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the throne room where he rapped upon the door  come in said oz  the scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window engaged in deep thought  i have come for my brains remarked the scarecrow a little uneasily  oh yes sit down in that chair please replied oz you must excuse me for taking your head off but i shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place  that\\u2019s all right said the scarecrow you are quite welcome to take my head off as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again  so the wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw then he entered the back room and took up a measure of bran which he mixed with a great many pins and needles having shaken them together thoroughly he filled the top of the scarecrow\\u2019s head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw to hold it in place  when he had fastened the scarecrow\\u2019s head on his body again he said to him hereafter you will be a great man for i have given you a lot of bran-new brains  the scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish and having thanked oz warmly he went back to his friends  dorothy looked at him curiously his head was quite bulged out at the top with brains  how do you feel she asked  i feel wise indeed he answered earnestly when i get used to my brains i shall know everything  why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head asked the tin woodman  that is proof that he is sharp remarked the lion  well i must go to oz and get my heart said the woodman so he walked to the throne room and knocked at the door  come in called oz and the woodman entered and said i have come for my heart  very well answered the little man but i shall have to cut a hole in your breast so i can put your heart in the right place i hope it won\\u2019t hurt you  oh no answered the woodman i shall not feel it at all  so oz brought a pair of tinsmith\\u2019s shears and cut a small square hole in the left side of the tin woodman\\u2019s breast then going to a chest of drawers he took out a pretty heart made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust  isn\\u2019t it a beauty he asked  it is indeed replied the woodman who was greatly pleased but is it a kind heart  oh very answered oz he put the heart in the woodman\\u2019s breast and then replaced the square of tin soldering it neatly together where it had been cut  there said he now you have a heart that any man might be proud of i\\u2019m sorry i had to put a patch on your breast but it really couldn\\u2019t be helped  never mind the patch exclaimed the happy woodman i am very grateful to you and shall never forget your kindness  don\\u2019t speak of it replied oz  then the tin woodman went back to his friends who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune  the lion now walked to the throne room and knocked at the door  come in said oz  i have come for my courage announced the lion entering the room  very well answered the little man i will get it for you  he went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish beautifully carved placing this before the cowardly lion who sniffed at it as if he did not like it the wizard said   drink  what is it asked the lion  well answered oz if it were inside of you it would be courage you know of course that courage is always inside one so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it therefore i advise you to drink it as soon as possible  the lion hesitated no longer but drank till the dish was empty  how do you feel now asked oz  full of courage replied the lion who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune  oz left to himself smiled to think of his success in giving the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion exactly what they thought they wanted how can i help being a humbug he said when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can\\u2019t be done it was easy to make the scarecrow and the lion and the woodman happy because they imagined i could do anything but it will take more than imagination to carry dorothy back to kansas and i\\u2019m sure i don\\u2019t know how it can be done     chapter xvii how the balloon was launched   for three days dorothy heard nothing from oz these were sad days for the little girl although her friends were all quite happy and contented the scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself when the tin woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast and he told dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh the lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the fierce kalidahs  thus each of the little party was satisfied except dorothy who longed more than ever to get back to kansas  on the fourth day to her great joy oz sent for her and when she entered the throne room he greeted her pleasantly   sit down my dear i think i have found the way to get you out of this country  and back to kansas she asked eagerly  well i\\u2019m not sure about kansas said oz for i haven\\u2019t the faintest notion which way it lies but the first thing to do is to cross the desert and then it should be easy to find your way home  how can i cross the desert she inquired  well i\\u2019ll tell you what i think said the little man you see when i came to this country it was in a balloon you also came through the air being carried by a cyclone so i believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air now it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone but i\\u2019ve been thinking the matter over and i believe i can make a balloon  how asked dorothy  a balloon said oz is made of silk which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it i have plenty of silk in the palace so it will be no trouble to make the balloon but in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with to make it float  if it won\\u2019t float remarked dorothy it will be of no use to us  true answered oz but there is another way to make it float which is to fill it with hot air hot air isn\\u2019t as good as gas for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert and we should be lost  we exclaimed the girl are you going with me  yes of course replied oz i am tired of being such a humbug if i should go out of this palace my people would soon discover i am not a wizard and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them so i have to stay shut up in these rooms all day and it gets tiresome i\\u2019d much rather go back to kansas with you and be in a circus again  i shall be glad to have your company said dorothy  thank you he answered now if you will help me sew the silk together we will begin to work on our balloon  so dorothy took a needle and thread and as fast as oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together first there was a strip of light green silk then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green for oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them it took three days to sew all the strips together but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long  then oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue to make it airtight after which he announced that the balloon was ready  but we must have a basket to ride in he said so he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon  when it was all ready oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother wizard who lived in the clouds the news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight  oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the palace and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity the tin woodman had chopped a big pile of wood and now he made a fire of it and oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air until finally the basket just touched the ground  then oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice   i am now going away to make a visit while i am gone the scarecrow will rule over you i command you to obey him as you would me  the balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground for the air within it was hot and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky  come dorothy cried the wizard hurry up or the balloon will fly away  i can\\u2019t find toto anywhere replied dorothy who did not wish to leave her little dog behind toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten and dorothy at last found him she picked him up and ran towards the balloon  she was within a few steps of it and oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket when crack went the ropes and the balloon rose into the air without her  come back she screamed i want to go too  i can\\u2019t come back my dear called oz from the basket good-bye  good-bye shouted everyone and all eyes were turned upward to where the wizard was riding in the basket rising every moment farther and farther into the sky  and that was the last any of them ever saw of oz the wonderful wizard though he may have reached omaha safely and be there now for all we know but the people remembered him lovingly and said to one another   oz was always our friend when he was here he built for us this beautiful emerald city and now he is gone he has left the wise scarecrow to rule over us  still for many days they grieved over the loss of the wonderful wizard and would not be comforted     chapter xviii away to the south   dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to kansas again but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon and she also felt sorry at losing oz and so did her companions  the tin woodman came to her and said   truly i should be ungrateful if i failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart i should like to cry a little because oz is gone if you will kindly wipe away my tears so that i shall not rust  with pleasure she answered and brought a towel at once then the tin woodman wept for several minutes and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel when he had finished he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oil-can to guard against mishap  the scarecrow was now the ruler of the emerald city and although he was not a wizard the people were proud of him for they said there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man and so far as they knew they were quite right  the morning after the balloon had gone up with oz the four travelers met in the throne room and talked matters over the scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him  we are not so unlucky said the new ruler for this palace and the emerald city belong to us and we can do just as we please when i remember that a short time ago i was up on a pole in a farmer\\u2019s cornfield and that now i am the ruler of this beautiful city i am quite satisfied with my lot  i also said the tin woodman am well-pleased with my new heart and really that was the only thing i wished in all the world  for my part i am content in knowing i am as brave as any beast that ever lived if not braver said the lion modestly  if dorothy would only be contented to live in the emerald city continued the scarecrow we might all be happy together  but i don\\u2019t want to live here cried dorothy i want to go to kansas and live with aunt em and uncle henry  well then what can be done inquired the woodman  the scarecrow decided to think and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains finally he said   why not call the winged monkeys and ask them to carry you over the desert  i never thought of that said dorothy joyfully it\\u2019s just the thing i\\u2019ll go at once for the golden cap  when she brought it into the throne room she spoke the magic words and soon the band of winged monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside her  this is the second time you have called us said the monkey king bowing before the little girl what do you wish  i want you to fly with me to kansas said dorothy  but the monkey king shook his head  that cannot be done he said we belong to this country alone and cannot leave it there has never been a winged monkey in kansas yet and i suppose there never will be for they don\\u2019t belong there we shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power but we cannot cross the desert good-bye  and with another bow the monkey king spread his wings and flew away through the window followed by all his band  dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment i have wasted the charm of the golden cap to no purpose she said for the winged monkeys cannot help me  it is certainly too bad said the tender-hearted woodman  the scarecrow was thinking again and his head bulged out so horribly that dorothy feared it would burst  let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers he said and ask his advice  so the soldier was summoned and entered the throne room timidly for while oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door  this little girl said the scarecrow to the soldier wishes to cross the desert how can she do so  i cannot tell answered the soldier for nobody has ever crossed the desert unless it is oz himself  is there no one who can help me asked dorothy earnestly  glinda might he suggested  who is glinda inquired the scarecrow  the witch of the south she is the most powerful of all the witches and rules over the quadlings besides her castle stands on the edge of the desert so she may know a way to cross it  glinda is a good witch isn\\u2019t she asked the child  the quadlings think she is good said the soldier and she is kind to everyone i have heard that glinda is a beautiful woman who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived  how can i get to her castle asked dorothy  the road is straight to the south he answered but it is said to be full of dangers to travelers there are wild beasts in the woods and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country for this reason none of the quadlings ever come to the emerald city  the soldier then left them and the scarecrow said   it seems in spite of dangers that the best thing dorothy can do is to travel to the land of the south and ask glinda to help her for of course if dorothy stays here she will never get back to kansas  you must have been thinking again remarked the tin woodman  i have said the scarecrow  i shall go with dorothy declared the lion for i am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again i am really a wild beast you know besides dorothy will need someone to protect her  that is true agreed the woodman my axe may be of service to her so i also will go with her to the land of the south  when shall we start asked the scarecrow  are you going they asked in surprise  certainly if it wasn\\u2019t for dorothy i should never have had brains she lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the emerald city so my good luck is all due to her and i shall never leave her until she starts back to kansas for good and all  thank you said dorothy gratefully you are all very kind to me but i should like to start as soon as possible  we shall go tomorrow morning returned the scarecrow so now let us all get ready for it will be a long journey     chapter xix attacked by the fighting trees   the next morning dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers who had walked with them as far as the gate when the guardian of the gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful city to get into new trouble but he at once unlocked their spectacles which he put back into the green box and gave them many good wishes to carry with them  you are now our ruler he said to the scarecrow so you must come back to us as soon as possible  i certainly shall if i am able the scarecrow replied but i must help dorothy to get home first  as dorothy bade the good-natured guardian a last farewell she said   i have been very kindly treated in your lovely city and everyone has been good to me i cannot tell you how grateful i am  don\\u2019t try my dear he answered we should like to keep you with us but if it is your wish to return to kansas i hope you will find a way he then opened the gate of the outer wall and they walked forth and started upon their journey  the sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the land of the south they were all in the best of spirits and laughed and chatted together dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were glad to be of use to her as for the lion he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again while toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies barking merrily all the time  city life does not agree with me at all remarked the lion as they walked along at a brisk pace i have lost much flesh since i lived there and now i am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous i have grown  they now turned and took a last look at the emerald city all they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls and high up above everything the spires and dome of the palace of oz  oz was not such a bad wizard after all said the tin woodman as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast  he knew how to give me brains and very good brains too said the scarecrow  if oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me added the lion he would have been a brave man  dorothy said nothing oz had not kept the promise he made her but he had done his best so she forgave him as he said he was a good man even if he was a bad wizard  the first day\\u2019s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the emerald city on every side they slept that night on the grass with nothing but the stars over them and they rested very well indeed  in the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood there was no way of going around it for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see and besides they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost so they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest  the scarecrow who was in the lead finally discovered a big tree with such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath so he walked forward to the tree but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers  this did not hurt the scarecrow but it surprised him and he looked rather dizzy when dorothy picked him up  here is another space between the trees called the lion  let me try it first said the scarecrow for it doesn\\u2019t hurt me to get thrown about he walked up to another tree as he spoke but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again  this is strange exclaimed dorothy what shall we do  the trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us and stop our journey remarked the lion  i believe i will try it myself said the woodman and shouldering his axe he marched up to the first tree that had handled the scarecrow so roughly when a big branch bent down to seize him the woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two at once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain and the tin woodman passed safely under it  come on he shouted to the others be quick they all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury except toto who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled but the woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free  the other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches and that probably these were the policemen of the forest and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it  the four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood then to their surprise they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china it was smooth like the surface of a dish and higher than their heads  what shall we do now asked dorothy  i will make a ladder said the tin woodman for we certainly must climb over the wall     chapter xx the dainty china country   while the woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest dorothy lay down and slept for she was tired by the long walk the lion also curled himself up to sleep and toto lay beside him  the scarecrow watched the woodman while he worked and said to him   i cannot think why this wall is here nor what it is made of  rest your brains and do not worry about the wall replied the woodman when we have climbed over it we shall know what is on the other side  after a time the ladder was finished it looked clumsy but the tin woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose the scarecrow waked dorothy and the lion and toto and told them that the ladder was ready the scarecrow climbed up the ladder first but he was so awkward that dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off when he got his head over the top of the wall the scarecrow said oh my  go on exclaimed dorothy  so the scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall and dorothy put her head over and cried oh my just as the scarecrow had done  then toto came up and immediately began to bark but dorothy made him be still  the lion climbed the ladder next and the tin woodman came last but both of them cried oh my as soon as they looked over the wall when they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall they looked down and saw a strange sight  before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors these houses were quite small the biggest of them reaching only as high as dorothy\\u2019s waist there were also pretty little barns with china fences around them and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens all made of china were standing about in groups  but the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country there were milkmaids and shepherdesses with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them and golden buckles on their shoes and princes with jeweled crowns upon their heads wearing ermine robes and satin doublets and funny clowns in ruffled gowns with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall pointed caps and strangest of all these people were all made of china even to their clothes and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than dorothy\\u2019s knee  no one did so much as look at the travelers at first except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice afterwards running away again  how shall we get down asked dorothy  they found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up so the scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet when all were safely down they picked up the scarecrow whose body was quite flattened out and patted his straw into shape again  we must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side said dorothy for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due south  they began walking through the country of the china people and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow as they drew near the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool the pail and even the milkmaid herself and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter  dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off and that the pail was lying in several small pieces while the poor milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow  there cried the milkmaid angrily see what you have done my cow has broken her leg and i must take her to the mender\\u2019s shop and have it glued on again what do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow  i\\u2019m very sorry returned dorothy please forgive us  but the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer she picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away the poor animal limping on three legs as she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers holding her nicked elbow close to her side  dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap  we must be very careful here said the kind-hearted woodman or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it  a little farther on dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young princess who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away  dorothy wanted to see more of the princess so she ran after her but the china girl cried out   don\\u2019t chase me don\\u2019t chase me  she had such a frightened little voice that dorothy stopped and said why not  because answered the princess also stopping a safe distance away if i run i may fall down and break myself  but could you not be mended asked the girl  oh yes but one is never so pretty after being mended you know replied the princess  i suppose not said dorothy  now there is mr joker one of our clowns continued the china lady who is always trying to stand upon his head he has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places and doesn\\u2019t look at all pretty here he comes now so you can see for yourself  indeed a jolly little clown came walking toward them and dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places  the clown put his hands in his pockets and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily he said       my lady fair    why do you stare at poor old mr joker     you\\u2019re quite as stiff     and prim as if you\\u2019d eaten up a poker   be quiet sir said the princess can\\u2019t you see these are strangers and should be treated with respect  well that\\u2019s respect i expect declared the clown and immediately stood upon his head  don\\u2019t mind mr joker said the princess to dorothy he is considerably cracked in his head and that makes him foolish  oh i don\\u2019t mind him a bit said dorothy but you are so beautiful she continued that i am sure i could love you dearly won\\u2019t you let me carry you back to kansas and stand you on aunt em\\u2019s mantel i could carry you in my basket  that would make me very unhappy answered the china princess you see here in our country we live contentedly and can talk and move around as we please but whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen and we can only stand straight and look pretty of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawing-room tables but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country  i would not make you unhappy for all the world exclaimed dorothy so i\\u2019ll just say good-bye  good-bye replied the princess  they walked carefully through the china country the little animals and all the people scampered out of their way fearing the strangers would break them and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall  it was not so high as the first however and by standing upon the lion\\u2019s back they all managed to scramble to the top then the lion gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall but just as he jumped he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces  that was too bad said dorothy but really i think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow\\u2019s leg and a church they are all so brittle  they are indeed said the scarecrow and i am thankful i am made of straw and cannot be easily damaged there are worse things in the world than being a scarecrow     chapter xxi the lion becomes the king of beasts   after climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall rank grass it was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight however by carefully picking their way they got safely along until they reached solid ground but here the country seemed wilder than ever and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen  this forest is perfectly delightful declared the lion looking around him with joy never have i seen a more beautiful place  it seems gloomy said the scarecrow  not a bit of it answered the lion i should like to live here all my life see how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home  perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now said dorothy  i suppose there are returned the lion but i do not see any of them about  they walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther dorothy and toto and the lion lay down to sleep while the woodman and the scarecrow kept watch over them as usual  when morning came they started again before they had gone far they heard a low rumble as of the growling of many wild animals toto whimpered a little but none of the others was frightened and they kept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the wood in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety there were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history and for a moment dorothy was afraid but the lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble  as he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic the biggest of the tigers came up to the lion and bowed saying   welcome o king of beasts you have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more  what is your trouble asked the lion quietly  we are all threatened answered the tiger by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest it is a most tremendous monster like a great spider with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk it has eight of these long legs and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth where he eats it as a spider does a fly not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us  the lion thought for a moment  are there any other lions in this forest he asked  no there were some but the monster has eaten them all and besides they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you  if i put an end to your enemy will you bow down to me and obey me as king of the forest inquired the lion  we will do that gladly returned the tiger and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar  we will  where is this great spider of yours now asked the lion  yonder among the oak trees said the tiger pointing with his forefoot  take good care of these friends of mine said the lion and i will go at once to fight the monster  he bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy  the great spider was lying asleep when the lion found him and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said and its body covered with coarse black hair it had a great mouth with a row of sharp teeth a foot long but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp\\u2019s waist this gave the lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monster\\u2019s back then with one blow of his heavy paw all armed with sharp claws he knocked the spider\\u2019s head from its body jumping down he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling when he knew it was quite dead  the lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said proudly   you need fear your enemy no longer  then the beasts bowed down to the lion as their king and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as dorothy was safely on her way to kansas     chapter xxii the country of the quadlings   the four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock  that will be a hard climb said the scarecrow but we must get over the hill nevertheless  so he led the way and the others followed they had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out keep back  who are you asked the scarecrow  then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said this hill belongs to us and we don\\u2019t allow anyone to cross it  but we must cross it said the scarecrow we\\u2019re going to the country of the quadlings  but you shall not replied the voice and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen  he was quite short and stout and had a big head which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles but he had no arms at all and seeing this the scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill so he said i\\u2019m sorry not to do as you wish but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not and he walked boldly forward  as quick as lightning the man\\u2019s head shot forward and his neck stretched out until the top of the head where it was flat struck the scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling over and over down the hill almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body and the man laughed harshly as he said it isn\\u2019t as easy as you think  a chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks and dorothy saw hundreds of the armless hammer-heads upon the hillside one behind every rock  the lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the scarecrow\\u2019s mishap and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder he dashed up the hill  again a head shot swiftly out and the great lion went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball  dorothy ran down and helped the scarecrow to his feet and the lion came up to her feeling rather bruised and sore and said it is useless to fight people with shooting heads no one can withstand them  what can we do then she asked  call the winged monkeys suggested the tin woodman you have still the right to command them once more  very well she answered and putting on the golden cap she uttered the magic words the monkeys were as prompt as ever and in a few moments the entire band stood before her  what are your commands inquired the king of the monkeys bowing low  carry us over the hill to the country of the quadlings answered the girl  it shall be done said the king and at once the winged monkeys caught the four travelers and toto up in their arms and flew away with them as they passed over the hill the hammer-heads yelled with vexation and shot their heads high in the air but they could not reach the winged monkeys which carried dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the quadlings  this is the last time you can summon us said the leader to dorothy so good-bye and good luck to you  good-bye and thank you very much returned the girl and the monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling  the country of the quadlings seemed rich and happy there was field upon field of ripening grain with well-paved roads running between and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them the fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the winkies and blue in the country of the munchkins the quadlings themselves who were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured were dressed all in red which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain  the monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse and the four travelers walked up to it and knocked at the door it was opened by the farmer\\u2019s wife and when dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies and a bowl of milk for toto  how far is it to the castle of glinda asked the child  it is not a great way answered the farmer\\u2019s wife take the road to the south and you will soon reach it  thanking the good woman they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful castle before the gates were three young girls dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid and as dorothy approached one of them said to her   why have you come to the south country  to see the good witch who rules here she answered will you take me to her  let me have your name and i will ask glinda if she will receive you they told who they were and the girl soldier went into the castle after a few moments she came back to say that dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once     chapter xxiii glinda the good witch grants dorothy\\u2019s wish   before they went to see glinda however they were taken to a room of the castle where dorothy washed her face and combed her hair and the lion shook the dust out of his mane and the scarecrow patted himself into his best shape and the woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints  when they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the witch glinda sat upon a throne of rubies  she was both beautiful and young to their eyes her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue and they looked kindly upon the little girl  what can i do for you my child she asked  dorothy told the witch all her story  how the cyclone had brought her to the land of oz how she had found her companions and of the wonderful adventures they had met with  my greatest wish now she added is to get back to kansas for aunt em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me and that will make her put on mourning and unless the crops are better this year than they were last i am sure uncle henry cannot afford it  glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet upturned face of the loving little girl  bless your dear heart she said i am sure i can tell you of a way to get back to kansas then she added but if i do you must give me the golden cap  willingly exclaimed dorothy indeed it is of no use to me now and when you have it you can command the winged monkeys three times  and i think i shall need their service just those three times answered glinda smiling  dorothy then gave her the golden cap and the witch said to the scarecrow what will you do when dorothy has left us  i will return to the emerald city he replied for oz has made me its ruler and the people like me the only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the hammer-heads  by means of the golden cap i shall command the winged monkeys to carry you to the gates of the emerald city said glinda for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler  am i really wonderful asked the scarecrow  you are unusual replied glinda  turning to the tin woodman she asked what will become of you when dorothy leaves this country  he leaned on his axe and thought a moment then he said the winkies were very kind to me and wanted me to rule over them after the wicked witch died i am fond of the winkies and if i could get back again to the country of the west i should like nothing better than to rule over them forever  my second command to the winged monkeys said glinda will be that they carry you safely to the land of the winkies your brain may not be so large to look at as those of the scarecrow but you are really brighter than he is\\u2014when you are well polished\\u2014and i am sure you will rule the winkies wisely and well  then the witch looked at the big shaggy lion and asked when dorothy has returned to her own home what will become of you  over the hill of the hammer-heads he answered lies a grand old forest and all the beasts that live there have made me their king if i could only get back to this forest i would pass my life very happily there  my third command to the winged monkeys said glinda shall be to carry you to your forest then having used up the powers of the golden cap i shall give it to the king of the monkeys that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore  the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion now thanked the good witch earnestly for her kindness and dorothy exclaimed   you are certainly as good as you are beautiful but you have not yet told me how to get back to kansas  your silver shoes will carry you over the desert replied glinda if you had known their power you could have gone back to your aunt em the very first day you came to this country  but then i should not have had my wonderful brains cried the scarecrow i might have passed my whole life in the farmer\\u2019s cornfield  and i should not have had my lovely heart said the tin woodman i might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world  and i should have lived a coward forever declared the lion and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me  this is all true said dorothy and i am glad i was of use to these good friends but now that each of them has had what he most desired and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides i think i should like to go back to kansas  the silver shoes said the good witch have wonderful powers and one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps and each step will be made in the wink of an eye all you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go  if that is so said the child joyfully i will ask them to carry me back to kansas at once  she threw her arms around the lion\\u2019s neck and kissed him patting his big head tenderly then she kissed the tin woodman who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints but she hugged the soft stuffed body of the scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades  glinda the good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a good-bye kiss and dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself  dorothy now took toto up solemnly in her arms and having said one last good-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times saying   take me home to aunt em   instantly she was whirling through the air so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears  the silver shoes took but three steps and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was  at length however she sat up and looked about her  good gracious she cried  for she was sitting on the broad kansas prairie and just before her was the new farmhouse uncle henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one uncle henry was milking the cows in the barnyard and toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn barking furiously  dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet for the silver shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air and were lost forever in the desert     chapter xxiv home again   aunt em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw dorothy running toward her  my darling child she cried folding the little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses where in the world did you come from  from the land of oz said dorothy gravely and here is toto too and oh aunt em i\\u2019m so glad to be at home again\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n
